The Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.
Alaskan marmots possess a short neck, broad and short head, small ears, short powerful legs and feet, bushy and densely furred tail, and a thick body covered in coarse hair.
As an adaption to the Arctic environment and permanently frozen ground, Alaska marmots breed prior to emerging from the winter den.
Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.
 Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet.","if a fur is short, then it might help its owner to better deal with the environment.",yes,99.55710768699646
1,"The wolverine is the largest land-dwelling species of the family Mustelidae.
Like many other mustelids, it has potent anal scent glands used for marking territory and sexual signaling. The pungent odor has given rise to the nicknames ""skunk bear"" and ""nasty cat.""

Several potential predators—jaguars and smaller cats like the margay—would love to make a meal out of a tamandua if it weren't so stinky! The bad smell lets other wildlife know where the tamandua is and usually sends them in the opposite direction.

The Striped Polecat is legendary for its ability to emit a foul smelling substance from its anal glands for protection. So powerful is this smell that personal observations include seeing an individual standing its ground against three lions which eventually moved away after much lip curling.","if a predator can't detect the prey, then it can't eat it.",yes,84.8359227180481
2,"Some researchers and members of the public use the term brumate to describe winter dormancy of reptiles, but the more general term hibernation is believed adequate to refer to any winter dormancy.

In most areas, groundhogs hibernate from October to March or April, but in more temperate areas, they may hibernate as little as three months. Groundhogs hibernate longer in northern latitudes than southern latitudes.

3,"Pet dogs can increase our dopamine, serotonin, and oxytocin levels. These are the “feel good” chemicals our brains release that improve mood and affect happiness. 

Studies have shown that even small interactions with dogs cause the human brain to produce oxytocin, a hormone often referred to as the “cuddle chemical.” Oxytocin increases feelings of relaxation, trust, and empathy while reducing stress and anxiety.

Just like people, cats can show their love through understanding and concern for others. In some instances, they have been known to risk their lives for their owners, protecting them from dangers like poisonous snakes or other hazards. Cats can also detect when their owner is upset and will often console them or, in some cases, even lick away their tears! But perhaps some of the most incredible evidence that cats do get attached to their owners is in the cases where cats have traveled miles upon miles to places they’ve never been in order to find their person.","if a dog is cute and friendly, then it probably gets attached to its owner.",yes,99.82649683952332

7,"A sunfish (or mola) is any fish in the Mola genus (family Molidae). Their population is considered stable, though they frequently are snagged in drift gill nets and can suffocate on sea trash, like plastic bags (which resemble jellyfish).

The sunfish is native to tropical and temperate waters around the world. 
In general, pelagic fishes also possess large pectoral fins that provide additional hydrodynamic lift and a large dorsal fin that acts to minimize body rolling during swimming.
The marine pelagic environment is the largest aquatic habitat on Earth.
Sharks are a group of elasmobranch fish characterized by a cartilaginous skeleton, five to seven gill slits on the sides of the head, and pectoral fins that are not fused to the head.

Crocodile embryos do not have sex chromosomes, and unlike humans, sex is not determined genetically. Sex is determined by temperature.
Lizards (suborder Lacertilia) are a widespread group of squamate reptiles, with over 6,000 species, ranging across all continents except Antarctica, as well as most oceanic island chains.
Sex determination in lizards can be temperature-dependent. The temperature of the eggs' micro-environment can determine the sex of the hatched young: low temperature incubation produces more females while higher temperatures produce more males.
Turtles are an order of reptiles known as Testudines, characterized by a shell developed mainly from their ribs.
Eggs of turtle vary between rounded, oval, elongated, and between hard- and soft-shelled. Most species have their sex determined by temperature. In some species, higher temperatures produce females and lower ones produce males, while in others, milder temperatures produce males and both hot and cold extremes produce females.","if an animal is cold-blooded, then it probably has a reptilian body.",yes,82.09402561187744

10,"The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes.
1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender.
2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat’s eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round.
3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes.
Venomous snakes usually have a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.
In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.","if the head of a snake is broad and flat with a narrow neck, then it is a venomous snake.",yes,99.81407523155212

13,"Bees feed on and require both nectar and pollen. Most pollen is used by bees as larvae food, but bees also transfer it from plant-to-plant, providing the pollination services needed by plants and nature as a whole.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer. When seeds grow near the parent plant, they may compete for water, light, and nutrients. When they are far away, they don’t compete with the parent or each other as much. There may have been diseases or other living things that attacked the parent plant. Birds may have moved the seeds away to a safer place.

Butterflies are great for your garden as they are attracted to bright flowers and need to feed on nectar. When they do this their bodies collect pollen and carry it to other plants. This helps fruits, vegetables and flowers to produce new seeds. The majority of plants need pollinators like bees and butterflies to reproduce.","if a fruit or a vegetable is attracted to flowers, then it is likely to be pollinated.",no,99.857097864151
14,"Flowers produce nectar as a reward for pollination, the process of transferring pollen from flower to flower. Many flowers need pollen to reproduce. However, because plants are immobile they need help with pollen transfer. An animal that transfers pollen from flower to flower is called a pollinator. By rewarding pollinators with nectar, the animals inadvertently help the plant with pollen transfer. This monarch, covered with sticky grains of pollen, is serving as a pollinator.

Plants can propagate themselves by having animals eat their fruit and then defecate the seeds elsewhere, although humans don't really contribute to the process in this way.

Fruit is organic plant matter which contains seeds; their 'intention' (if such a term can be applied to plants) is that they are eaten by animals. The seeds will not be digested but excreted, usually whole, in a nutrient-rich manner which will enable them to grow where they land. Essentially, fruit is the plant's way to transport its seeds.","if an animal can provide pollinators, then the plant will produce more food and grow more quickly.",yes,99.6699571609497

The ""greening"" of the continents occurred during the Devonian. The covering of the planet's continents with massive photosynthesizing land plants in the first forests may have reduced CO2 levels in the atmosphere. Since CO2 is a greenhouse gas, reduced levels might have helped produce a chillier climate.","if a planet has more land than water, then it might be colder.",no,99.64364767074585

It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs (called ""trigger hairs"" or ""sensitive hairs"") on their inner surfaces.

Pitcher plants are several different carnivorous plants which have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—a prey-trapping mechanism featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The traps of what are considered to be ""true"" pitcher plants are formed by specialized leaves. The plants attract and drown their prey with nectar.

Drosera, which is commonly known as the sundews, is one of the largest genera of carnivorous plants, with at least 194 species.
The trapping and digestion mechanism of Drosera usually employs two types of glands: stalked glands that secrete sweet mucilage to attract and ensnare insects and enzymes to digest them, and sessile glands that absorb the resulting nutrient soup.","if a plant traps its prey, then it has a lot of stalks or hairs.",yes,98.55499267578125

It is commonly found in afro-temperate forests and often in mountainous areas. In harsh or exposed areas it tends to become stunted, small and dense.

The name live oak comes from the fact that evergreen oaks remain green and ""live"" throughout winter, when other oaks are dormant and leafless. The name is used mainly in North America, where evergreen oaks are widespread in warmer areas.
Live Oak gets some kind of precipitation, on average, 93 days per year.
Nearly all eucalyptus are evergreen, but some tropical species lose their leaves at the end of the dry season. 
There are more than 700 species of eucalyptus and most are native to Australia; a very small number are found in adjacent areas of New Guinea and Indonesia.

Summary:
1.Both doldrums and horse latitudes are ocean areas characterized by weak or nonexistent airflow for a prolonged period of time. Both areas are also located in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In addition, both places are near the equator.
2.Doldrums and horse latitudes are situated in different locations near the equator. Doldrums are placed at five degrees north and south of the equator. Meanwhile, horse latitudes are located at 30 degrees north and south latitude.

The horse latitudes are located at about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. It is common in this region of the subtropics for winds to diverge and either flow toward the poles (known as the prevailing westerlies) or toward the equator (known as the trade winds).

A side that perceives itself to be at a marked disadvantage may deliberately seek out attrition warfare to neutralize its opponent's advantages over time. Sun Tzu has stated, that there is no country that has benefitted from prolonged warfare, but Russia in 1812 won the war with attrition warfare against Napoleon.

But in World War I military commanders on both sides relied on attrition warfare resulting in terrible casualties without a strategic result.[citation needed]
Among the many problems with attrition warfare are these:
High death tolls — This is the primary issue. Although all wars involve casualties, attrition warfare increases the number of combatants and civilians who are killed.
High costs — Attrition warfare requires a lot of resources.
The potential for an unstable outcome — The outcome of attrition warfare is not always clear. A nation which is battered into submission may rebel in the future, and tensions are exacerbated.
