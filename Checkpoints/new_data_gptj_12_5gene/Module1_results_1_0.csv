Do not include '__' in generation. \nFact:\n The tiger has fairly stout teeth; its somewhat curved canines are the longest among living felids with a crown height of up to 90 mm. \nA baby tiger’s milk teeth break through at the age of about two weeks. They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks.\nPolar Bears’ large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. \nMature polar bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat.\nWolf’s teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. \nWolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Its orbit around the Sun takes 87.97 Earth days, the shortest of all the Sun's planets.\nThis is widely presumed to be what we have in the now internationally accepted figure of\xa01: 6023 600\xa0for the mass of Mercury compared with that of the Sun.\nEarth orbits the Sun at an average distance of about 150\xa0million\xa0km every 365.2564 mean solar days, or one\xa0sidereal year.\nThe mass of the sun is 1.989 x 1030 kilograms, about 333,000 times the mass of the Earth.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If a planet orbits around a star, then the mass of the planet is less than the mass of the star.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and may have dense or sleek fur.\nThe Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.\nPolar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.\n Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

A general consensus among historians is that by the early 17th century, the Renaissance had come to an end. \n\nThe Renaissance is a period in European history marking the transition from the Middle Ages to modernity and covering the 15th and 16th centuries, characterized by an effort to revive and surpass ideas and achievements of classical antiquity. It occurred after the Crisis of the Late Middle Ages and was associated with great social change. In addition to the standard periodization, proponents of a ""long Renaissance"" may put its beginning in the 14th century and its end in the 17th century.\n\nThe Renaissance was a period in Europe, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.

It is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka extending east to Burma and parts of Bhutan and Nepal. It has been introduced in many other parts of the world and has established itself in New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Fiji, as well as parts of Samoa, Australia, USA and Cook Islands. It is included in the list of the world\'s 100 worst invasive alien species.\nPycnonotus cafer (red-vented bulbul) is a noisy, gregarious bird distinguished by a conspicuous crimson patch below the root of the tail. It is aggressive and chases off other bird species and may also help to spread the seeds of other invasive species. It is an agricultural pest, destroying fruit, flowers, beans, tomatoes and peas.\n\nWild boar has no natural predators in Brazil, as it is an exotic species, in addition to breeding with the domestic pig, generating the so-called ""javaporco"" (neologism created to define this hybrid), factors that contribute to the exaggerated increase in the population. With its population in continuous and uncontrolled growth, without predators, the wild boar causes environmental damage, contributing to the aggradation of river and stream springs, attacking native species feeding on eggs and puppies, causing damage to fauna, flora and to agriculture and livestock, since it also attacks farm animals and can carry various diseases, including zoonosis.\nThe Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), also known as the starry sky, sky beetle, or ALB, is native to eastern China, and Korea. This species has now been accidentally introduced into the United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as Canada, and several countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and UK. \nDue to high tree mortality caused by larval feeding outside its native range, A. glabripennis can change both forest and urban ecosystems.

Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth.\nThe outer layer of the cacti's stem usually has a tough cuticle, reinforced with waxy layers, which reduce water loss. These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti.\nCacti are good crops for dry areas because they convert water into biomass efficiently. \nA perennial shrub, O. ficus-indica can grow up to 5 m in height, with thick, succulent, and oblong to spatulate stems called cladodes.

Colony life has many advantages, one of the most important being increased protection for the entire group.\n\nAnts have been demonstrated to show impressive cognitive control abilities, suppressing a dominant response (e.g., feeding) in order to carry out a secondary goal (e.g., searching for a feeding tool). \nAs is the case with wild coalitions, the Zoo’s lions have a complex social hierarchy.

However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993). Stronger evidence for impact is present for the F–F boundary (as summarized in Wang et al., 1996), including microtektites, meteoritic elemental ratios, known impact craters, and high-energy (tsunami?) deposits.

However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival.
