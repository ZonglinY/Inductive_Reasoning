The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior).
