The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Do not include \'__\' in generation. \nFact:\n Polar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent. Two genes that are known to influence melanin production, LYST and AIM1, are both mutated in polar bears, possibly leading to the absence on this pigment in their fur. The guard hair is 5–15 cm (2–6 in) over most of the body. Polar bears gradually moult from May to August, but, unlike other Arctic mammals, they do not shed their coat for a darker shade to provide camouflage in summer conditions. The hollow guard hairs of a polar bear coat were once thought to act as fiber-optic tubes to conduct light to its black skin, where it could be absorbed; however, this hypothesis was disproved by a study in 1998.\nThe polar bear (Ursus maritimus) is a hypercarnivorous bear whose native range lies largely within the Arctic Circle, encompassing the Arctic Ocean, its surrounding seas and surrounding land masses. It is the largest extant bear species, as well as the largest extant land carnivore. A boar (adult male) weighs around 350–700 kg (770–1,540 lb), while a sow (adult female) is about half that size. Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. Although most polar bears are born on land, they spend most of their time on the sea ice. Their scientific name means ""maritime bear"" and derives from this fact. Polar bears hunt their preferred food of seals from the edge of sea ice, often living off fat reserves when no sea ice is present. Because of their dependence on the sea ice, polar bears are classified as marine mammals. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule', 'Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

There are 360 living and recently extinct species of turtles, including land-dwelling tortoises and freshwater terrapins. They are found on most continents, some islands and, in the case of sea turtles, much of the ocean. Like other reptiles, birds, and mammals, they breathe air and do not lay eggs underwater, although many species live in or around water.

Eggs vary between rounded, oval, elongated, and between hard- and soft-shelled. Most species have their sex determined by temperature. In some species, higher temperatures produce females and lower ones produce males, while in others, milder temperatures produce males and both hot and cold extremes produce females. There is experimental evidence that the embryos of Mauremys reevesii can move around inside their eggs to select the best temperature for development, thus influencing their sexual destiny.

It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant\'s leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs (called ""trigger hairs"" or ""sensitive hairs"") on their inner surfaces.\nThe leaf blade of Venus flytrap is divided into two regions: a flat, heart-shaped photosynthesis-capable petiole, and a pair of terminal lobes hinged at the midrib, forming the trap which is the true leaf. The upper surface of these lobes contains red anthocyanin pigments and its edges secrete mucilage. The lobes exhibit rapid plant movements, snapping shut when stimulated by prey. The trapping mechanism is tripped when prey contacts one of the three hair-like trichomes that are found on the upper surface of each of the lobes. The mechanism is so highly specialized that it can distinguish between living prey and non-prey stimuli, such as falling raindrops; two trigger hairs must be touched in succession within 20 seconds of each other or one hair touched twice in rapid succession, whereupon the lobes of the trap will snap shut, typically in about one-tenth of a second. The edges of the lobes are fringed by stiff hair-like protrusions or cilia, which mesh together and prevent large prey from escaping. These protrusions, and the trigger hairs (also known as sensitive hairs) are likely homologous with the tentacles found in this plant\'s close relatives, the sundews.

As the brightest natural object in Earth\'s night sky after the Moon, Venus can cast shadows and can be visible to the naked eye in broad daylight. Venus\' orbit is smaller than that of Earth, but its maximal elongation is 47°; thus, it can be seen not only near the Sun in the morning or evening, but also a couple of hours before or after sunrise or sunset, depending on the observer\'s latitude and on the positions of Venus and the Sun. Most of the time, it can be seen either in the morning or in the evening. At some times, it may even be seen a while in a completely dark sky. Venus orbits the Sun every 224.7 Earth days. It has a synodic day length of 117 Earth days and a sidereal rotation period of 243 Earth days. Consequently, it takes longer to rotate about its axis than any other planet in the Solar System, and does so in the opposite direction to all but Uranus.

It is radically different from Earth in other respects. It has the densest atmosphere of the four terrestrial planets, consisting of more than 96% carbon dioxide. The atmospheric pressure at the planet\'s surface is about 92 times the sea level pressure of Earth, or roughly the pressure at 900 m (3,000 ft) underwater on Earth. Even though Mercury is closer to the Sun, Venus has the hottest surface of any planet in the Solar System, with a mean temperature of 737 K (464 °C; 867 °F). Venus is shrouded by an opaque layer of highly reflective clouds of sulfuric acid, preventing its surface from being seen from space in light. It may have had water oceans in the past, but these would have vaporized as the temperature rose under a runaway greenhouse effect.

Something about this big ball of bluish-green gas just seems ... off. A closer look at the planet’s cloud bands and 13 faint rings gives you your answer: Uranus is off its rocker! Scientists suspect that a planet-size object knocked Uranus sideways in the early days of its formation. It has spun like a top toppling over ever since, which makes for some oddball seasons and decades devoid of even a glint of the sun’s faint light. The north pole is locked in more than 20 years of darkness in the winter and just as much sunlight in the summer, yet the temperature varies little here on the solar system’s coldest planet. Crank up the ship’s heater, young astronaut. You have wandered far from the sun.\n\nLike Jupiter and Saturn, Uranus is a gas giant—a ball of gas surrounding an Earth-size core of hot liquids. More specifically, Uranus is considered an “ice giant” because its atmosphere is composed mostly of “icy” water, ammonia, and methane. Researchers have found that Uranus’ crushing atmosphere can compress methane into precious rocks.

The steam engine uses the force produced by steam pressure to push a piston back and forth inside a cylinder. This pushing force can be transformed, by a connecting rod and crank, into rotational force for work. The term ""steam engine"" is generally applied only to reciprocating engines as just described, not to the steam turbine. Steam engines are external combustion engines, where the working fluid is separated from the combustion products. The ideal thermodynamic cycle used to analyze this process is called the Rankine cycle. In general usage, the term steam engine can refer to either complete steam plants (including boilers etc.), such as railway steam locomotives and portable engines, or may refer to the piston or turbine machinery alone, as in the beam engine and stationary steam engine.\nAlthough steam-driven devices were known as early as the aeolipile in the first century AD, with a few other uses recorded in the 16th century, in 1606 Jerónimo de Ayanz y Beaumont patented his invention of the first steam-powered water pump for draining mines. Thomas Savery is considered the inventor of the first commercially used steam powered device, a steam pump that used steam pressure operating directly on the water. The first commercially successful engine that could transmit continuous power to a machine was developed in 1712 by Thomas Newcomen. James Watt made a critical improvement in 1764, by removing spent steam to a separate vessel for condensation, greatly improving the amount of work obtained per unit of fuel consumed.

Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as coalition forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba\'athist government; Saddam Hussein was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed three years later. The power vacuum following Saddam\'s demise and mismanagement by the Coalition Provisional Authority led to widespread civil war between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against coalition forces. The United States responded with a build-up of 170,000 troops in 2007. This build-up gave greater control to Iraq\'s government and military, and was judged a success by many.

He used the French name Le merle hupé du Cap de Bonne Espérance and the Latin Merula Cristata Capitis Bonae Spei. Although Brisson coined Latin names, these do not conform to the binomial system and are not recognised by the International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature. When in 1766 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his Systema Naturae for the twelfth edition, he added 240 species that had been previously described by Brisson. One of these was the red-vented bulbul. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name Turdus cafer and cited Brisson's work. The red-vented bulbul does not occur in Africa. The type location was later changed to Sri Lanka and then in 1952 designated as Pondicherry in India by the German naturalist Erwin Stresemann.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, South Africa is home to around a third of all succulent species. While it is often thought that most succulents come from dry areas such as steppes, semi-desert, and desert, the world's driest areas do not make for proper succulent habitats, mainly due to the difficulty such low growing plants or seedlings would have to thrive in environments where they could easily be covered by sand. Australia, the world's driest inhabited continent, hosts very few native succulents due to the frequent and prolonged droughts[citation needed]. Even Africa, the continent with the most native succulents, does not host many of the plants in its most dry regions. However, while succulents are unable to grow in these harshest of conditions, they are able to grow in conditions that are uninhabitable by other plants. In fact, many succulents are able to thrive in dry conditions, and some are able to last up to two years without water depending on their surroundings and adaptations. Occasionally, succulents may occur as epiphytes, growing on other plants with limited or no contact with the ground, and being dependent on their ability to store water and gaining nutrients by other means; it is seen in Tillandsia. Succulents also occur as inhabitants of sea coasts and dry lakes, which are exposed to high levels of dissolved minerals that are deadly to many other plant species. California is home to close to hundred succulent species that are native to the state, many of them live in coastal environments. Potted succulents are able to grow in most indoor environments with minimal care.\nSucculent plant has waxy, hairy, or spiny outer surface to create a humid micro-habitat around the plant, which reduces air movement near the surface of the plant, and thereby reduces water loss and may create shade. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

According to the World Wildlife Fund, South Africa is home to around a third of all succulent species. While it is often thought that most succulents come from dry areas such as steppes, semi-desert, and desert, the world's driest areas do not make for proper succulent habitats, mainly due to the difficulty such low growing plants or seedlings would have to thrive in environments where they could easily be covered by sand. Australia, the world's driest inhabited continent, hosts very few native succulents due to the frequent and prolonged droughts[citation needed]. Even Africa, the continent with the most native succulents, does not host many of the plants in its most dry regions. However, while succulents are unable to grow in these harshest of conditions, they are able to grow in conditions that are uninhabitable by other plants. In fact, many succulents are able to thrive in dry conditions, and some are able to last up to two years without water depending on their surroundings and adaptations. Occasionally, succulents may occur as epiphytes, growing on other plants with limited or no contact with the ground, and being dependent on their ability to store water and gaining nutrients by other means; it is seen in Tillandsia. Succulents also occur as inhabitants of sea coasts and dry lakes, which are exposed to high levels of dissolved minerals that are deadly to many other plant species.

This pride is made up of her mother, sisters, aunts, and cousins, as well as one to three males who may or may not be related to her. When a male cub is born into a pride, he is typically only allowed to stay until he is 18-24 months old. At this time, male lions are becoming sexually mature, and their presence is no longer tolerated by the dominant male or males of the pride. These dispersing sub-adult males may be sexually mature, but they’re not socially mature and often lack the skills needed to challenge a current “reigning” male for the right to a pride. It is normal for a male lion to be 5-7 years old before he is successful at having a pride of his very own. In this sub-adult phase of a male lion’s life, he will either disperse on his own, or he will disperse with other related males and form a coalition. These coalitions may stay together for life, and coalitions of males have been known to protect a pride together with one male being dominant over the others. The Zoo’s lions, who are brothers, are now 6.5 years old, and we fully expect them to continue to live together as a coalition unless the Lion Species Survival Plan® (SSP) recommends otherwise.\n\nAs is the case with wild coalitions, the Zoo’s lions have a complex social hierarchy. They are strongly bonded to each other and are always nearby, or at least aware of, the others’ locations. Naming the most dominant male of the group is complicated. Hatari has always seemed to be more dominant over his brothers. He always seems to do as he pleases, going where he wants when he wants. However, when the brothers bicker (which all siblings are apt to do), it is always Azizi who steps in as the peacemaker to diffuse the tension. This leads us to believe that Azizi is the most dominant of the coalition. Hondo is the most subordinate of the three. He is the most opinionated and tends to show the most posturing and dominance behaviors, which he almost always directs toward Hatari. Hatari is a good sport about Hondo’s behavior and “picks his battles.” He submits to Hondo, which we can hear in his vocalizations and see in his body posture, but he also doesn� \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

So now you know: Not only is it fascinating that lions are a truly social cat species, but they also have a really cool social structure!\nThe social intelligence hypothesis proposes that the challenges of complex social life bolster the evolution of intelligence, and accordingly, advanced cognition has convergently evolved in several social lineages. Lions (Panthera leo) offer an ideal model system for cognitive research in a highly social species with an egalitarian social structure. We investigated cognition in lions using a novel resource task: the suspended puzzle box. The task required lions (n = 12) to solve a novel problem, learn the techniques used to solve the problem, and remember techniques for use in future trials. The majority of lions demonstrated novel problem-solving and learning; lions (11/12) solved the task, repeated success in multiple trials, and significantly reduced the latency to success across trials. Lions also demonstrated cognitive abilities associated with memory and solved the task after up to a 7-month testing interval. We also observed limited evidence for social facilitation of the task solution. Four of five initially unsuccessful lions achieved success after being partnered with a successful lion.

Exceptions include the diurnal northern hawk-owl and the gregarious burrowing owl.\n\nOwls hunt mostly small mammals, insects, and other birds, although a few species specialize in hunting fish. They are found in all regions of the Earth except the polar ice caps and some remote islands.\n\nOwls are divided into two families: the true (or typical) owl family, Strigidae, and the barn-owl family, Tytonidae.\n\nA group of owls is called a ""parliament"".\n\nOwls possess large, forward-facing eyes and ear-holes, a hawk-like beak, a flat face, and usually a conspicuous circle of feathers, a facial disc, around each eye. The feathers making up this disc can be adjusted to sharply focus sounds from varying distances onto the owls\' asymmetrically placed ear cavities. Most birds of prey have eyes on the sides of their heads, but the stereoscopic nature of the owl\'s forward-facing eyes permits the greater sense of depth perception necessary for low-light hunting. Although owls have binocular vision, their large eyes are fixed in their sockets—as are those of most other birds—so they must turn their entire heads to change views. As owls are farsighted, they are unable to clearly see anything within a few centimetres of their eyes.

Female owls are typically larger than the males. The degree of size dimorphism varies across multiple populations and species, and is measured through various traits, such as wing span and body mass.\n\nOne theory suggests that selection has led males to be smaller because it allows them to be efficient foragers. The ability to obtain more food is advantageous during breeding season. In some species, female owls stay at their nest with their eggs while it is the responsibility of the male to bring back food to the nest. If food is scarce, the male first feeds himself before feeding the female. Small birds, which are agile, are an important source of food for owls. Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females. Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.[citation needed] \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule:', 'Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.[citation needed] \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule']","['if a man has a big head and a long neck, then he is probably a man', 'there exist species of owls, which are smaller than the smallest species of bird', 'if a female is bigger than a male, then it is a dimorphic species', ""if there is a female owl, then it's a male owl"", 'if owls have a different sex, then they probably have differences in their body parts', 'there exist owls, which can be smaller than other birds', 'if a bird is smaller than prey and is capable of catching prey, then it probably can catch prey in large amounts', 'if you are not sure about the fact, just leave it blank', 'if a bird can catch small animals, then it might be able to catch larger animals', 'if a mammal is carnivorous, then it will eat a mammal', 'if a male owl is larger than a female owl, then it is likely that the male owl has more muscles', 'there exist species of owl, which are small in size', 'if a male is larger than female, then they are dimorphic', 'if a bird has a long beak, then it has a high agility', 'if a bird has no sexual dimorphism, then it probably has no special body features', 'there exist a bird, which is smaller than the male of the species', 'there exists a bird, which is smaller than the male of the species', 'there exist a bird, which is smaller than the male of the', 'if the number of vertebrae in the neck is larger, then the neck of an owl is more flexible', ""if a bird can eat less or can't feed its mate, then it might have smaller size"", 'if a creature is sexually dimorphic, then it probably has sharp teeth', 'there exist an animal named owl, which is larger than the largest animal in the world', 'if a person has longer wings, then the person is probably more agile', 'if a bird is more agile or bigger than other birds, then it is probably the predator']","['If an animal has convergent eyes (eyes positioned to face forward on the head), then that animal likely exhibits predatory behavior.']","["": If a man has a big head and a long neck, then he is probably a man.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Most academics do not refer to this time as darker, as it is difficult for historians to fully explain the span of time between the rise and fall of empires that ruled Europe. Prior to the beginning of the Dark Ages, Romans ruled European lands. Their contributions to European development were most notable in the areas of science, philosophy, government, and architecture. The fall of Rome and the ensuing disbursement of people throughout Western Europe negatively impacted the process of keeping historical documentation, making it difficult for historians to maintain accurate assessments of the period.\n\nThroughout the Dark Ages in Europe, the fall of the Roman Empire greatly impacted the migration of humans across Western Europe. This time period was once thought to be a time lacking in cultural, scientific, and economic growth, but it was an impactful time for Europe itself. After the Roman Empire transformed into one of Germanic traditions, kingdoms and monarchs rose to prominence. Political policy, rulers, and religion became the driving forces of European culture. Christianity, more specifically, Catholicism ruled the system of churches. This time period produced splendid Gothic art and architecture and also witnessed the Crusades.\nThe cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope. A church and state bond began and continued throughout the entirety of the Dark Ages.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if a period of time ends, then the period that followed was dark', 'there exist a time period and a location where the roman empire and the western roman empire became separated, the roman empire was divided in half, and the western roman empire was destroyed', 'if the empire split into half and the king took the throne of rome, then there is a good chance for the rise of the kingdom', 'if an event in history caused a chain reaction that lead to another event, then that event might be one of the cause of the fall of the roman empire', 'if the roman empire is divided into two parts, then the dark ages will continue for a long period of time', 'there exist a time period in european history and a ruler who was a king, where a church and state bond began and continued throughout the entirety of the dark ages', 'if a person was once emperor of rome and converted to christianity, then he is a christian', 'if a place is a kingdom, then it might be a monarchy', 'if an empire collapsed, then it is very likely that there will be no culture in the following centuries', 'if the collapse of an empire leads to no culture in the following centuries, then', 'there exist events that started the fall of the roman empire, which led to the dark ages', 'if a kingdom was ruled by an emperor, then it was roman empire', 'if the roman empire or christianity transformed europe, then it had a great impact on its history', 'if an empire or a religion has great influence on the world, then it might lead to more wars', 'if the fall of a city or empire occurred in the dark ages, then it might have been a dark time for europe', 'there exist a time of great change, and this change led to a decline of the western roman empire, and a great number of people became displaced', 'if a country is ruled by a king and have a church and state bond, then it is most likely to be in the dark ages', 'if a person has a long life, then he or she might have a high level of knowledge and experience', 'if a roman empire is divided into two halves, then it is most likely to suffer a collapse of power', 'there exist a dark period in the european history, which starts with the fall of the roman empire and ends with the conversion of clovis, when the church and state relationship starts', 'if a time is considered as dark ages, then the country ruled by king odoacer is considered as western roman empire', 'if a leader can make more power or more money, then his country will be better off', 'if a man can be famous, then he will have much power']","['If a socio-political structure is abruptly dismantled without the establishment of a robust alternative system, then it often leads to a period of chaos, violence, or power vacuum in the society']","["": If a period of time ends, then the period that followed was dark.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Private firms were encouraged by government financial support and aided by the institution of a European-style banking system in 1882. Those efforts at modernization required Western science and technology, and, under the banner of “Civilization and Enlightenment” (“Bunmei kaika”), Western culture, from current intellectual trends to clothing and architecture, was widely promoted.\nWholesale Westernization was somewhat checked in the 1880s, however, when a renewed appreciation of traditional Japanese values emerged. Such was the case in the development of a modern educational system that, though influenced by Western theory and practice, stressed the traditional values of samurai loyalty and social harmony. Those precepts were codified in 1890 with the enactment of the Imperial Rescript on Education (Kyōiku Chokugo).

The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.\nDuring its Golden Age, Athens was an artistic and intellectual hub. If there was a new contribution in the arts or sciences during this era in Greece, chances are that it was the work of an Athenian.\n\nAthenians had an appreciation for poetry and drama. They enjoyed theater events in the genres of comedy, tragedy, and satire. Like today, there wore costumes and read from scripts. Performers the wore masks and and would stand in a semicircle. Some performers even gained celebrity-like status. Two of the most famous stage performers of the Golden Age were Euripides and Sophocles.\nFrom Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.\n\nWith this preference for reason came a critique of traditional ways of living, believing, and thinking, which sometimes caused political trouble for the philosophers themselves. Xenophanes directly challenged the traditional anthropomorphic depiction of the gods, and Socrates was put to death for allegedly inventing new gods and not believing in the gods mandated by the city of Athens. After the fall of Alexander the Great, and because of Aristotle’s ties with Alexander and his court, Aristotle escaped the same fate as Socrates by fleeing Athens. Epicurus, like Xenophanes, claimed that the mass of people is impious, since the people conceive of the gods as little more than super \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.\nDuring its Golden Age, Athens was an artistic and intellectual hub. If there was a new contribution in the arts or sciences during this era in Greece, chances are that it was the work of an Athenian.\n\nAthenians had an appreciation for poetry and drama. They enjoyed theater events in the genres of comedy, tragedy, and satire. Like today, there wore costumes and read from scripts. Performers the wore masks and and would stand in a semicircle. Some performers even gained celebrity-like status. Two of the most famous stage performers of the Golden Age were Euripides and Sophocles.\nFrom Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.\n\nWith this preference for reason came a critique of traditional ways of living, believing, and thinking, which sometimes caused political trouble for the philosophers themselves. Xenophanes directly challenged the traditional anthropomorphic depiction of the gods, and Socrates was put to death for allegedly inventing new gods and not believing in the gods mandated by the city of Athens. After the fall of Alexander the Great, and because of Aristotle’s ties with Alexander and his court, Aristotle escaped the same fate as Socrates by fleeing Athens. Epicurus, like Xenophanes, claimed that the mass of people is impious, since the people conceive of the gods as little more than superhumans, even though human characteristics cannot appropriately be ascribed to the gods. In short, not only did ancient Greek philosophy pave the way for the Western intellectual tradition, including modern science, but it also shook cultural foundations in its own time. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule:"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

These by-products of natural gas are important, because what matters to end users is not crude oil, but usable petroleum liquids.

As a result of unconventional oil and gas production, production of natural gas liquids (NGL) such as propane and butane increased about 30 percent during 2008–12. These by-products of natural gas are important, because what matters to end users is not crude oil, but usable petroleum liquids. The combined rise in crude oil and NGL production resulted in an increase in total liquids production from about 6.9 to 8.7 million barrels a day during 2008–12, a 26 percent increase.\n\nMoreover, NGL production is likely to increase further. Current estimates suggest that the shale gas resource basis in the United States is sizable. The EIA-commissioned study also concluded that the technically recoverable amount of undeveloped shale gas resources is 750 trillion cubic feet, about 31 times total U.S. annual gas production. The ultimate recovery surely will be smaller, but largely thanks to shale gas, the estimated proved reserves of natural gas in the United States have risen rapidly in recent years, after declining in the 1970s and 1980s and stagnating in the 1990s.\n\nU.S. natural gas markets are still adjusting to the surprise increase in shale gas production. Over the past few years, prices have fallen to levels not seen in decades, both in dollar terms and relative to other energy sources—mainly coal and crude oil.\nUS shale producers are on course to make nearly $200 billion this year, enough to make the industry debt-free by 2024 and potentially fund a pivot toward more natural gas production, according to Deloitte LLP. \n\nHigh oil prices and disciplined capital spending mean American frackers are on course for their most profitable year on record, part of a global trend that will see the oil and gas industry generate a record $1.4 trillion of free cash flow, Deloitte said in a report.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nThe second key weakness of the traditional model that Netflix was able to exploit was the lack of suitable movie alternatives. New movies made up over 70% of all rentals from Blockbuster stores. Therefore, Blockbuster store shelves primarily catered to new releases while ignoring older movies. Netflix on the other hand, leveraged technology to introduce the concept of queueing movies (to allow users to pick more than one movie – allowing the company to send at least one movie to the customer) and later providing movie recommendations based on customer preferences (thereby reducing the customer’s need to only watch new movies). This allowed Netflix to differentiate itself from Blockbuster and its competitors as users loved getting movie recommendations from Netflix. Another consequence of this innovation was that it allowed Netflix to wield more power when dealing with its suppliers – such as movie studios. Independent movie studios – for example – were keen to release their movies through Netflix since they did not have to spend exorbitant amounts of money to capture the attention of the public. Instead, they could leverage the recommendation system of Netflix to gain viewership.\n\nA third, and possibly the biggest weakness of the traditional home video industry was the dependence on revenue earned in late fees. In the view of customers, the late fees that Blockbuster and other stores charged were exorbitant (often higher than the cost of the original rental itself) and arbitrarily enforced (kicking in within minutes of the deadline with no room for leniency). Although Netflix started out with the pricing model followed by the industry, it quickly evolved and debuted the unlimited prepaid rental plan – whereby a user did not have to pay any late fees for rentals. This pricing model was marketed very aggressively by Netflix, and quickly won over customers due this model.

Although Netflix started out with the pricing model followed by the industry, it quickly evolved and debuted the unlimited prepaid rental plan – whereby a user did not have to pay any late fees for rentals. This pricing model was marketed very aggressively by Netflix, and quickly won over customers due this model. This subscription model allowed Netflix to earn a constant (and predictable) revenue stream while allowing it to gain cost leadership over its rivals.\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. \n\nBy 2004, Netflix had already seen a dramatic increase in profits to $21.38 million on over $500 million in revenues, and these figures continued to grow even more by 2005. However, it wasn’t until 2007 that Netflix began to truly establish itself as a major player in the entertainment industry, with streaming becoming available to customers that year. This proved instrumental for their business. By 2009, the company’s annual revenue had skyrocketed to over $1.5 billion — more than five times higher than six years earlier, when it first posted its profit. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule:"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nThe second key weakness of the traditional model that Netflix was able to exploit was the lack of suitable movie alternatives. New movies made up over 70% of all rentals from Blockbuster stores. Therefore, Blockbuster store shelves primarily catered to new releases while ignoring older movies. Netflix on the other hand, leveraged technology to introduce the concept of queueing movies (to allow users to pick more than one movie – allowing the company to send at least one movie to the customer) and later providing movie recommendations based on customer preferences (thereby reducing the customer’s need to only watch new movies). This allowed Netflix to differentiate itself from Blockbuster and its competitors as users loved getting movie recommendations from Netflix. Another consequence of this innovation was that it allowed Netflix to wield more power when dealing with its suppliers – such as movie studios. Independent movie studios – for example – were keen to release their movies through Netflix since they did not have to spend exorbitant amounts of money to capture the attention of the public. Instead, they could leverage the recommendation system of Netflix to gain viewership.\n\nA third, and possibly the biggest weakness of the traditional home video industry was the dependence on revenue earned in late fees.
