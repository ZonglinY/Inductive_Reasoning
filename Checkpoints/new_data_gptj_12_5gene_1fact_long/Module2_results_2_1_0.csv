Just like people, cats can show their love through understanding and concern for others. In some instances, they have been known to risk their lives for their owners, protecting them from dangers like poisonous snakes or other hazards. Cats can also detect when their owner is upset and will often console them or, in some cases, even lick away their tears! But perhaps some of the most incredible evidence that cats do get attached to their owners is in the cases where cats have traveled miles upon miles to places they’ve never been in order to find their person.

The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes.
1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender.
2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat’s eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round.
3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes.
Venomous snakes usually have a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.
In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

19,"The Venus flytrap (Dionaea muscipula) is a carnivorous plant native to subtropical wetlands on the East Coast of the United States in North Carolina and South Carolina. It catches its prey—chiefly insects and arachnids—with a trapping structure formed by the terminal portion of each of the plant's leaves, which is triggered by tiny hairs (called ""trigger hairs"" or ""sensitive hairs"") on their inner surfaces.

Pitcher plants are several different carnivorous plants which have modified leaves known as pitfall traps—a prey-trapping mechanism featuring a deep cavity filled with digestive liquid. The plants attract and drown their prey with nectar.

Butterflies are great for your garden as they are attracted to bright flowers and need to feed on nectar. When they do this their bodies collect pollen and carry it to other plants. This helps fruits, vegetables and flowers to produce new seeds. The majority of plants need pollinators like bees and butterflies to reproduce.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it.

42,"The ""doldrums"" is a popular nautical term that refers to the belt around the Earth near the equator where sailing ships sometimes get stuck on windless waters.

The horse latitudes are located at about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. It is common in this region of the subtropics for winds to diverge and either flow toward the poles (known as the prevailing westerlies) or toward the equator (known as the trade winds). These diverging winds are the result of an area of high pressure, which is characterized by calm winds, sunny skies, and little or no precipitation.


Summary:
1.Both doldrums and horse latitudes are ocean areas characterized by weak or nonexistent airflow for a prolonged period of time. Both areas are also located in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In addition, both places are near the equator.

Sun authored the military treatise Sun Bin's Art of War, which was rediscovered in a 1972 archaeological excavation after being lost for almost 2000 years.

History, first and foremost, teaches us the consequences of our actions. Whether we look back to last week and decide which restaurant we go to based on our experiences, or we look back across thousands of years to determine if starting a land war in Asia is a wise idea, we can learn to make important choices based on what happened in the past. We can pick the restaurant with the fast service and get our lunch quickly, or we can decide that trying to conquer China is just a bad idea. Either way, we've learned from someone's (ours or someone else's) actions.
History also reminds us of what reality is. Sometimes we set ourselves up in boxes, making decisions based on our small worldviews. History reminds us that truth really is stranger than fiction.

Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females. Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.
Tigers have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment and stalking prey.

107,"The fall of the Roman Empire ushered in a time of great change throughout Europe, and with it, what is referred to by some as the Dark Ages, a five-hundred-year time period from roughly 500 CE to 1000 CE. 
The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope. A church and state bond began and continued throughout the entirety of the Dark Ages.
French Revolution, also called Revolution of 1789, revolutionary movement that shook France between 1787 and 1799 and reached its first climax there in 1789—hence the conventional term “Revolution of 1789,” denoting the end of the ancien régime in France and serving also to distinguish that event from the later French revolutions of 1830 and 1848.

The Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union[a] was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union (USSR), which resulted in the end of the existence of the country and of its federal government as a sovereign state, which in turn resulted in its constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991. It brought an end to General Secretary (later also President) Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and economic backslide.

The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE.

110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. 
The digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.

Since the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the
development of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of
broadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of

The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. 
The digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.

Since the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the
development of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of
broadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of
digital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards
a digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital
technologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions.","if a printing press is the only way to spread information, then the printing press is the revolution of communication.","If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.",34.71006453037262
110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.

112,"A “golden age” is a time of peace, prosperity, and happiness, and often occurs when cultural activities such as art or writing reach a peak. The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.

From Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.

The Tang Dynasty (618-907) witnessed the first period of florescence in the reign (627-649) of Emperor Taizong, which was called the Prosperity of Zhenguan, an era of peace and prosperity.

The Quan Tangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone. This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. The two most famous poets of the period were Li Bai and Du Fu. 
If the Enlightenment can be defined as an emancipatory call for reason, a concern for more analytic and systematic explanations, or a claim to greater freedom, happiness and equality for mankind, then eighteenth-century economic thought as a specific inquiry into principles or laws governing the economy of a civil society, whether named science of trade or political economy, takes part in this vision. It might be said that economic thought contributed to the promotion of a civil and commercial culture insofar as it sought to achieve peace and prosperity within the nation and between nations. It is in this sense that in the eighteenth-century Europe science of trade and political economy were regarded as new and hopeful sciences.

One of the reasons that Uber has grown so quickly is that it doesn’t have the same overhead expenses as traditional cab companies. A less complex infrastructure also allows companies to adapt to changes more quickly, enabling them to avoid some of the problems that would otherwise hinder growth. As an example, since labor accounts for a large share of most transportation companies’ operating costs, Uber has been able to save money by hiring noncommercial drivers.

More than 20 employees have been fired from Uber as part of an internal investigation, a company spokesperson told CNBC, after a former employee alleged gender bias and sexual harassment within the start-up.

114,"In the period from 1843 to 1845, the English astronomer John Couch Adams analyzed all  the existing Uranus data.  In October, 1845, he proposed an answer: there is another massive planet out there.  The gravitational tug of that planet influences Uranus' orbit.  He predicted where and how big that planet must be.  British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn't take the prediction very seriously and didn't push his staff to make the necessary observations.


The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.


That discovery marked our first glimpse of the long-sought Kuiper Belt, named after Gerard Kuiper who, in 1951, proposed that a belt of icy bodies might lay beyond Neptune.

However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993). Stronger evidence for impact is present for the F–F boundary (as summarized in Wang et al., 1996), including microtektites, meteoritic elemental ratios, known impact craters, and high-energy (tsunami?) deposits. However, reported iridium enrichments at the stratotype area for the F–F boundary in southern France were not subsequently substantiated (Girard et al., 1997), and no F–F iridium anomaly was found in New York State

An iridium anomaly has been found in coincidence with the known microtektite level in cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project site 149 in the Caribbean Sea. The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.

The sharing economy, also known as collaborative consumption or peer-to-peer-based sharing, is a concept that highlights the ability -- and perhaps the preference -- of individuals to rent or borrow goods rather than buy and own them.

An important criterion of the sharing economy is that it enables individuals to monetize assets that are not being fully utilized. Underutilized assets range from large goods, such as cars and houses, to products such as tools, toys and clothing.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. 

The company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide. According to CNBC, Uber generated $12.7 billion in gross bookings in the third quarter of 2018. On an adjusted pro-forma basis, it recorded a net loss of $768 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

This involves buying stocks that seem to be undervalued and selling them years later when they achieve their deserved market value.

BRRRR investing is another effective strategy made popular by Brandon Turner on Bigger Pockets. BRRRR stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance and repeat:

Buy: Buy a property at below-market value.

Rehab: Renovate and improve the property by adding value.

Rent: Rent out the property to cover the mortgage.

Refinance: Get the property reappraised, then use cash-out refinancing to secure an advantageous mortgage.

Repeat: Use the capital you recovered from the deal to invest in more properties.

With BRRRR, the idea is to capitalize on a property others may have overlooked due to its low face value or apparent lack of potential.

Jeff Bezos surely does believe in holding long-term investments. This is a common trait among the world’s top investors. Long-term investment produces gain with higher profit that usually cannot be gained in a short period. But the work philosophy behind long-term investments is the same- conduct thorough research and analysis of the companies you wish to invest in. Do your homework well and reap the benefits in the long-run. Don’t give into market conditions and withdraw your long-term investments. This will backfire and cause unprecedented losses.

Passive income enables businesses to build their wealth and improve cash flow, leading to increased financial stability and security. In effect, passive income increases bottom line profits, saves time and expands a business’s reach. For some entrepreneurs, passive income allows for location independence, as in the case of digital nomads.

Other benefits of passive income may include less stress, time to pursue other projects and passions, and early retirement. But remember, these benefits come from a significant amount of time spent in active income pursuits, sometimes for years, before passive income begins to stream in.

The primary benefit of investing in passive income is that it has the potential to generate consistent returns with minimal effort. Passive income can help diversify your portfolio beyond traditional investments such as stocks and bonds by providing alternative returns such as rental properties or royalties from published works. Investing in passive income allows you to get your money working for you since and not actively monitor your investments daily.

The Spotify model encourages autonomy and creativity by trusting people to complete the work they are doing in the way they see fit. Do you need to ship software? That’s up to the Squad.
