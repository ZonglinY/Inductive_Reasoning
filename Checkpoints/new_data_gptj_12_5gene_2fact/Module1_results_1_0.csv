They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks.\nPolar Bears’ large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. \nMature polar bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat.\nWolf’s teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. \nWolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny.

In October, 1845, he proposed an answer: there is another massive planet out there.  The gravitational tug of that planet influences Uranus' orbit.  He predicted where and how big that planet must be.  British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn't take the prediction very seriously and didn't push his staff to make the necessary observations.\n\n\nThe existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.\n\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","[""if a man doesn't have a precise understanding of the world, then he probably is arrogant"", 'there exist a planet outside our solar system which is much smaller and much further from the sun than all the other planets', 'if a person is a great astronomer and he predicted a planet and the planet was discovered, then he probably was a great astronomer', '| if a person is a great astronomer and he predicted a planet and the planet was discovered, then he probably was a great', 'if a person has a plan, he probably has a precise understanding about the world', 'if a person does not have a plan, he might have some ideas about the world', 'if there exists a planet with the given property, then there exists a planet with the given property', 'if a man discovers a new world, then it is a planet', 'if the first man who discovers a planet is a man, then the planet discovered', 'if a celestial object has a high density, then it might be the planet uranus', ""if someone doesn't give up, then they can eventually find what they are looking for"", 'there exist a planet called pluto that is bigger than the dwarf planet ceres', 'if a scientist is born in the same year as an astronomer, then he probably has the same opinion on astronomy', 'if a person has a good memory, then he or she might know a lot of stuff', 'if a planet is discovered, then the planet probably exists', 'there exist at least one planet in the solar system that is heavier than the planet pluto', 'there exist at least one planet in the solar system that is heavier than the planet', 'if a person is searching for something, then he will likely to find it sooner or later', 'if a discovery can help humanity better understand the universe, then it will be published or announced', 'if an astronomer searches for a planet, then he probably discovers it', 'there exist a planet in the solar system which was discovered in 1930', 'if a person lives and does research in an environment that is unknown, then his discoveries would be very unexpected', 'if a place has a lot of people, or a lot of history, then it probably has a lot of culture']","['If a celestial body is observed to have an irregular orbit, then it often indicates the gravitational influence of another, as-yet-undiscovered celestial body.']","["": If a man doesn't have a precise understanding of the world, then he probably is arrogant.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Among many reasons, the Finnish system relies on high-quality, extremely well-trained and committed teachers for it to work. Since most education systems lack this critical ingredient, it is not possible to directly implement current Finnish practices.\nFree comprehensive schools for children between seven and sixteen replaced the two-tier system of grammar schools and civic schools. Initially, the comprehensive school system was centrally controlled, before the eventual transfer of authority to local municipalities and teachers. The outcomes of the reforms are clear: education standards have increased in Finland, educational inequality has decreased, and Finland has a competitive economy based on its highly-educated, skilled workforce.\nThere is no doubt that Singapore's strong educational system contributes to its economic growth. To ensure that its workforce is highly skilled and educated, the country places a strong emphasis on education and training.
