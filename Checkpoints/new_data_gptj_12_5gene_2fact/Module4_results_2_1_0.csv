The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes.
1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender.
2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat’s eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round.
3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes.
Venomous snakes usually have a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.
In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.
","if a venomous snake has a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head, then it probably has a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.","If a snake has a large and triangle head and has a colorful skin and will curl up and prepare to attack when meet danger, then it probably is venomous.",47.49795198440552

Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

With over 180,000 described species, the Lepidoptera are not only diverse in their numbers but also in coloration. Their colors arise due to the nature of the scales they produce and can be due to pigmentation as well as structural color. Whatever the origin, color results from an interaction between light and matter.


Butterfly wings are made of two protein membranes that are covered in thousands of scales and tiny hairs. These wing scales are overlapping pieces of the protein chitin and are modified, plate-like setae. The colors and patterns of butterfly and moth wings come from these layers of tiny scales. There are many purposes for the scales and their coloration.

Butterflies are great for your garden as they are attracted to bright flowers and need to feed on nectar. When they do this their bodies collect pollen and carry it to other plants. This helps fruits, vegetables and flowers to produce new seeds. The majority of plants need pollinators like bees and butterflies to reproduce.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer. When seeds grow near the parent plant, they may compete for water, light, and nutrients. When they are far away, they don’t compete with the parent or each other as much. There may have been diseases or other living things that attacked the parent plant. Birds may have moved the seeds away to a safer place.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer.

The squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a pale, dull-coloured velvety cap up to 30 cm (12 in), extraordinarily 40 cm (16 in), very rarely 50 cm (20 in) across, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red-patterned stem.
Russula emetica, commonly known as the sickener, emetic russula, or vomiting russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom, and the type species of the genus Russula. It has a red, convex to flat cap up to 8.5 cm (3.3 in) in diameter, with a cuticle that can be peeled off almost to the centre.
The mushroom's common names refer to the gastrointestinal distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling. 
Amanita muscaria poisoning has occurred in young children and in people who ingested the mushrooms for a hallucinogenic experience.

However, because plants are immobile they need help with pollen transfer. An animal that transfers pollen from flower to flower is called a pollinator. By rewarding pollinators with nectar, the animals inadvertently help the plant with pollen transfer. This monarch, covered with sticky grains of pollen, is serving as a pollinator.

42,"The ""doldrums"" is a popular nautical term that refers to the belt around the Earth near the equator where sailing ships sometimes get stuck on windless waters.

The horse latitudes are located at about 30 degrees north and south of the equator. It is common in this region of the subtropics for winds to diverge and either flow toward the poles (known as the prevailing westerlies) or toward the equator (known as the trade winds). These diverging winds are the result of an area of high pressure, which is characterized by calm winds, sunny skies, and little or no precipitation.

Neutron stars are among the densest objects in the universe. A big difference between a neutron star and a black hole is that a neutron star would be having a hard surface unlike that of a black hole.
Black holes are some of the strangest and most fascinating objects in space. They're extremely dense, with such strong gravitational attraction that not even light can escape their grasp. 

This stellar duo, known as Terzan 5 CX1, has a neutron star (the extremely dense remnant left behind by a supernova explosion) in close orbit around a star similar to the Sun, but with less mass.
A new study suggests how strong they are: The crust of neutron stars could be 10 billion times stronger than steel, based on an innovative model of elements compressed as tightly as they would be on the surface of a neutron star.

107,"The fall of the Roman Empire ushered in a time of great change throughout Europe, and with it, what is referred to by some as the Dark Ages, a five-hundred-year time period from roughly 500 CE to 1000 CE. 
The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE.

The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope.

The damage inflicted by U-boats during World War I was powerful. Their ability to submerge and to surprise enemies led to massive casualties: Germany and Austria-Hungary sank almost 5,000 merchant ships during World War I, killing approximately 15,000 Allied sailors. The Treaty of Versailles required the Germans to surrender and break up their U-boat fleet, but German naval commanders had learned the value of submarine warfare and continued to improve this technology in peacetime years. German U-boats returned to North Carolina during World War II with a vengeance, leaving even more wrecks off the coast.

110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. 
The digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication.

These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.

The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America.

The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. 
The digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.

Since the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the
development of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of
broadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of
digital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards
a digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital
technologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions.","if the economy is digitalized, then the economy has become digitalized.","If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.",37.23779618740082

Following the May 1990 elections, Gorbachev faced conflicting internal political pressures: Boris Yeltsin and the pluralist movement advocated democratization and rapid economic reforms while the hard-line Communist elite wanted to thwart Gorbachev’s reform agenda.

The dismantling of the Soviet Union had many long-lasting effects on the global economy and the region’s foreign trade. Its downfall increased the United States’ influence as a global power and created an opportunity for corruption and crime in Russia. It also prompted many cultural changes and social upheavals in former Soviet nations and smaller neighboring communist countries. Between 1989 and 1991, the gross national product in Soviet countries fell by 20 percent, ushering in a period of complete economic breakdown.

The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.

From Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.

The Tang Dynasty (618-907) witnessed the first period of florescence in the reign (627-649) of Emperor Taizong, which was called the Prosperity of Zhenguan, an era of peace and prosperity.

The Quan Tangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society.

If the Enlightenment can be defined as an emancipatory call for reason, a concern for more analytic and systematic explanations, or a claim to greater freedom, happiness and equality for mankind, then eighteenth-century economic thought as a specific inquiry into principles or laws governing the economy of a civil society, whether named science of trade or political economy, takes part in this vision. It might be said that economic thought contributed to the promotion of a civil and commercial culture insofar as it sought to achieve peace and prosperity within the nation and between nations.

One of the reasons that Uber has grown so quickly is that it doesn’t have the same overhead expenses as traditional cab companies. A less complex infrastructure also allows companies to adapt to changes more quickly, enabling them to avoid some of the problems that would otherwise hinder growth. As an example, since labor accounts for a large share of most transportation companies’ operating costs, Uber has been able to save money by hiring noncommercial drivers.

More than 20 employees have been fired from Uber as part of an internal investigation, a company spokesperson told CNBC, after a former employee alleged gender bias and sexual harassment within the start-up.

114,"In the period from 1843 to 1845, the English astronomer John Couch Adams analyzed all  the existing Uranus data.  In October, 1845, he proposed an answer: there is another massive planet out there.  The gravitational tug of that planet influences Uranus' orbit.  He predicted where and how big that planet must be.  British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn't take the prediction very seriously and didn't push his staff to make the necessary observations.


The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.


That discovery marked our first glimpse of the long-sought Kuiper Belt, named after Gerard Kuiper who, in 1951, proposed that a belt of icy bodies might lay beyond Neptune. It was the only way, he figured, to solve a baffling mystery about comets: Some comets loop through the solar system on periodic orbits of a half-dozen years or so. They encounter the Sun so often that they quickly evaporate -- vanishing in only a few hundred thousand years. Astronomers call them ""short-period comets,"" although ""short-lived"" is more to the point. Short-period comets evaporate so quickly compared to the age of the solar system that we shouldn't see any, yet astronomers routinely track dozens of them. It was a real puzzle.

His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.


That discovery marked our first glimpse of the long-sought Kuiper Belt, named after Gerard Kuiper who, in 1951, proposed that a belt of icy bodies might lay beyond Neptune. It was the only way, he figured, to solve a baffling mystery about comets: Some comets loop through the solar system on periodic orbits of a half-dozen years or so. They encounter the Sun so often that they quickly evaporate -- vanishing in only a few hundred thousand years. Astronomers call them ""short-period comets,"" although ""short-lived"" is more to the point. Short-period comets evaporate so quickly compared to the age of the solar system that we shouldn't see any, yet astronomers routinely track dozens of them. It was a real puzzle.

He predicted where and how big that planet must be.

The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H.

116,"The Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago. 

An iridium anomaly has been found in coincidence with the known microtektite level in cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project site 149 in the Caribbean Sea. The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary.

Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993).

The sharing economy, also known as collaborative consumption or peer-to-peer-based sharing, is a concept that highlights the ability -- and perhaps the preference -- of individuals to rent or borrow goods rather than buy and own them.

An important criterion of the sharing economy is that it enables individuals to monetize assets that are not being fully utilized. Underutilized assets range from large goods, such as cars and houses, to products such as tools, toys and clothing.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector.

Among many reasons, the Finnish system relies on high-quality, extremely well-trained and committed teachers for it to work. Since most education systems lack this critical ingredient, it is not possible to directly implement current Finnish practices.
Free comprehensive schools for children between seven and sixteen replaced the two-tier system of grammar schools and civic schools. Initially, the comprehensive school system was centrally controlled, before the eventual transfer of authority to local municipalities and teachers.

This involves buying stocks that seem to be undervalued and selling them years later when they achieve their deserved market value.

BRRRR investing is another effective strategy made popular by Brandon Turner on Bigger Pockets. BRRRR stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance and repeat:

Buy: Buy a property at below-market value.

Rehab: Renovate and improve the property by adding value.

Rent: Rent out the property to cover the mortgage.

Refinance: Get the property reappraised, then use cash-out refinancing to secure an advantageous mortgage.

Repeat: Use the capital you recovered from the deal to invest in more properties.

With BRRRR, the idea is to capitalize on a property others may have overlooked due to its low face value or apparent lack of potential.

Passive income enables businesses to build their wealth and improve cash flow, leading to increased financial stability and security. In effect, passive income increases bottom line profits, saves time and expands a business’s reach. For some entrepreneurs, passive income allows for location independence, as in the case of digital nomads.

Other benefits of passive income may include less stress, time to pursue other projects and passions, and early retirement. But remember, these benefits come from a significant amount of time spent in active income pursuits, sometimes for years, before passive income begins to stream in.

The primary benefit of investing in passive income is that it has the potential to generate consistent returns with minimal effort. Passive income can help diversify your portfolio beyond traditional investments such as stocks and bonds by providing alternative returns such as rental properties or royalties from published works. Investing in passive income allows you to get your money working for you since and not actively monitor your investments daily.

Though the idea was hatched in 2008, the business did not commence operations until two years later.


Slack was originally developed as a solution to a problem for game developers. In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.

 

The tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.

You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.

Because of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”

Thus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.

Slack was originally developed as a solution to a problem for game developers. In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.

 

The tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.

Because of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”

Thus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.
