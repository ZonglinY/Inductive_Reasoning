They start to eat meat at the age of eight weeks.\nPolar Bears’ large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. \nMature polar bears tend to eat only the calorie-rich skin and blubber of the seal, which are highly digestible, whereas younger bears consume the protein-rich red meat.\nWolf’s teeth are heavy and large, making them better suited to crushing bone than those of other canids. \nWolves can digest their meal in a few hours and can feed several times in one day, making quick use of large quantities of meat.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope. A church and state bond began and continued throughout the entirety of the Dark Ages.\nFrench Revolution, also called Revolution of 1789, revolutionary movement that shook France between 1787 and 1799 and reached its first climax there in 1789—hence the conventional term “Revolution of 1789,” denoting the end of the ancien régime in France and serving also to distinguish that event from the later French revolutions of 1830 and 1848.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if a man starts a revolution, then he might face failure', 'there exist a political and economic system in the western roman empire, that ends the period of time known as dark ages', 'if the events mentioned in facts are the cause of the fall of the roman empire, then the revolution in france occurred in 1789', 'if a group has a leader, then they might change from time to time', 'if a revolution happened in the past, then there probably wasn’t a period of peace during that time', 'there exist an event, which ended the roman empire and the western roman empire', 'there exists an event, which ended the roman empire and the western roman empire', 'if a revolution begins in a country and lasts for a long time, then the revolution is likely to be violent', 'if there is a war, then a country must have an army and government', 'if there is a war, then the government must have an army', 'if there is a church and state bond, then there is no civil war', 'if there is no church and state bond, then there will be a civil war', 'there exist a series of events in history that led to a downfall of the roman empire, which was followed by the dark ages', 'if a revolution starts because of a person, then it will most likely be a revolution', 'if a society becomes too large and corrupt, then its government might become tyrannical', 'if the roman empire fell, then the dark ages began', 'there exist a political event and a religious movement that occurred in the history of france', 'if a revolution has resulted in the creation of a new state, then it will be a revolution of 1789', 'if a revolution happened, then it might be a sign of the end of the current era and the beginning of a new era', 'if two events occurred in a particular order, then it must be the result of a previous event', 'there exist events, where a person, who was an important leader of an event, has a name that starts with the letter “q”', 'if a revolution is a radical change that leads to a new political system, then the revolution of 1789 caused a radical change in the political system in france', 'if something happens to an empire, then it will likely collapse']","['If a socio-political structure is abruptly dismantled without the establishment of a robust alternative system, then it often leads to a period of chaos, violence, or power vacuum in the society']","["": If a man starts a revolution, then he might face failure.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Iridium anomalies have been identified at or near the F–F (Playford et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1991) and Devonian–Carboniferous (Wang et al., 1993) boundaries. However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. \nAn iridium anomaly has been found in coincidence with the known microtektite level in cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project site 149 in the Caribbean Sea. The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. \nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago.  \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if there is an iridium anomaly, then there might be a bolide impact', 'there exist an impact event 66 million years ago that marks the cretaceous-paleogene (k-pg) mass extinction', 'if an event is caused by extraterrestrial impact, then it is probably the cretaceous-paleogene extinction event', 'if the cause of the extinction is due to impact by a', 'if an asteroid or comet strikes the earth, then there might be a huge destruction', 'if an asteroid or comet hits a planet, then the mass of the planet will decrease', 'there exist a planet and a period of time that is coincident with the cretaceous-tertiary mass extinction event, and it is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, deposited by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago', 'if the extinction happened, it was caused by extraterrestrial impact', 'if a natural event such as an impact is detected, then a species might be extinct', 'if there is an iridium anomaly, then it probably results from an impact event', 'there exist an iridium-rich bolide impact event 66 million years ago', 'if a mass extinction is caused by meteorite impact, then it would be caused by a hypervelocity impact event', 'if there is a large amount of iridium in a rock, then a meteorite hit it', 'if a massive meteor hit earth, then it will be marked by an iridium anomaly', 'there exist a microtektite and a bolide impact', 'if an impact event happened 66 million years ago and the elevated concentration of iridium, then a bolide impact event happened', 'if an impact event happened 66 million years ago,', 'if an event happened before a big change in a planet or an animal, then it is probably important', 'if a planet contains iridium, then it might have been hit by a meteorite', 'there exist an extraterrestrial impact event at the k-pg boundary', 'if an event occurs in the past, then its causes should be determined', 'if the reason of an event is known, then the causes of the event can be determined', 'if an object is metallic, then it might has higher chances of being produced from a meteorite']","['If there is an unusually high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rock strata, then a large extraterrestrial impact event (like an asteroid or comet strike) likely occurred']","["": If there is an iridium anomaly, then there might be a bolide impact.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.
