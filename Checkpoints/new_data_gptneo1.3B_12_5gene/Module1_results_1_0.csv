The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and may have dense or sleek fur.\nThe Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.\nPolar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.\n Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

It is a resident breeder across the Indian subcontinent, including Sri Lanka extending east to Burma and parts of Bhutan and Nepal. It has been introduced in many other parts of the world and has established itself in New Zealand, Argentina, Tonga and Fiji, as well as parts of Samoa, Australia, USA and Cook Islands. It is included in the list of the world\'s 100 worst invasive alien species.\nPycnonotus cafer (red-vented bulbul) is a noisy, gregarious bird distinguished by a conspicuous crimson patch below the root of the tail. It is aggressive and chases off other bird species and may also help to spread the seeds of other invasive species. It is an agricultural pest, destroying fruit, flowers, beans, tomatoes and peas.\n\nWild boar has no natural predators in Brazil, as it is an exotic species, in addition to breeding with the domestic pig, generating the so-called ""javaporco"" (neologism created to define this hybrid), factors that contribute to the exaggerated increase in the population. With its population in continuous and uncontrolled growth, without predators, the wild boar causes environmental damage, contributing to the aggradation of river and stream springs, attacking native species feeding on eggs and puppies, causing damage to fauna, flora and to agriculture and livestock, since it also attacks farm animals and can carry various diseases, including zoonosis.\nThe Asian long-horned beetle (Anoplophora glabripennis), also known as the starry sky, sky beetle, or ALB, is native to eastern China, and Korea. This species has now been accidentally introduced into the United States, where it was first discovered in 1996, as well as Canada, and several countries in Europe, including Austria, France, Germany, Italy and UK. \nDue to high tree mortality caused by larval feeding outside its native range, A. glabripennis can change both forest and urban ecosystems. In the United States, it can potentially destroy 30.3% of urban trees and cause $669 billion in economic loss.  \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule']","['if an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth', 'there exist plants that can exist in forests and/or cities', 'if a species is naturally found in a region and has no natural predators, then it can potentially cause environmental damage', 'if a plant can survive in rain, then it should have', ""if a species' range is not covered by natural predators, then it might be extinct"", 'there exist wild boar that is heavier than the heaviest terrestrial animal of all time', 'if a native insect is introduced, and it is native to the native range of the insect, then it should be considered native', 'if a carnivore is frightened or hungry, it might attack', 'if an insect is introduced into an ecosystem, then it is probably likely to take over the role of its native predator or competitors', 'there exist currently native wild boar that are more tolerant of environmental changes', 'if a species has no natural predators, then it probably is an alien species', 'there exist a plant that can live in a desert', 'if a species is native to a region, but has a new introduction in the new region, it is a naturalist', 'if a star has the ability to reduce the amount of light passing through the atmosphere, or cause the sun to appear in a less prominent position, then it probably is a potential threat to human beings', 'if an animal has a natural predator, then it probably has a natural predator, too', 'there exist two species of bats in the world that eat flies and are dangerous to humans:', 'there exists two species of bats in the world that eat flies and are dangerous to humans:', 'if a pest is native to a particular area, then it is a pest', 'if the adult has two or more horns, then the hornless individuals have an advantage in finding food']","['If an animal is an exotic species, then it may negatively affect the local environment.']","["": If an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. \n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.\n\nUber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services.

In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.\n\n \n\nThe tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.\n\nA lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying. Not only did you have to go to a grocery store or pharmacy, but usually the razors were locked on the shelf or guarded behind the checkout counter. You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.\n\nBecause of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”\n\nThus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.\n\nWarby Parker was launched in 2010 by four students of tswohe Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. Some of the features of the initiatives introduced by the quartet include affordability, bypassing orthodox channels by designing frames in-house, and taking cognizance of customers’ specifications.\nThe company which was set up under the Wharton School’s Venture Initiation Program was created to close the perceived existing lacuna between users of medicated glasses and the providers of such services.
