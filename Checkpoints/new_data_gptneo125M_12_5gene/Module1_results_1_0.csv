The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and may have dense or sleek fur.\nThe Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.\nPolar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.\n Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity.

First came the\ndevelopment of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of\nbroadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of\ndigital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards\na digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital\ntechnologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if a plant has pests, then it probably has pests', 'there exist a large variety of species, including the most widely known ones of', 'if an animal is nourished by the milks of females and is vertebrate, then it is mammal', 'if a machine can produce more than one piece of material, it probably will produce more', 'if a man is arrogant, then he probably does not have a precise understanding of the world and might encounter with failure', 'there exist a plant that can live in a desert', 'if a digital currency is a currency of digital media, then it has a', 'if an electronic currency is a currency of digital media, then it has a couple of values: a digital asset price and a digital currency price', 'if a digital currency is a digital currency of a digital media, then it has a couple of values: a', 'if a place is mountainous or has large rivers, then it probably can help troops to better defend from their enemies', 'if an animal eats meat, then it probably has large and sharp teeth', 'there exist currently living animals like the\xa0mauna loa', 'if a company has a small budget, they are less likely to be the largest', 'an animal needs a small amount of milk per day, but if the milk is a\xa0little bit less, it does not need to be fed', 'if a plant has a bitter taste, or a funny smell, or milky sap, then it might have higher surface temperature', 'if a plant has a bitter taste, or a funny smell, or milky sap, then it might have lower surface temperature', 'if a computer has a web browser, then the web browser may be a computer program that can access the internet', 'if a computer has a browser, then the browser may be a computer program that can access the internet', 'there exist a plant that is heavier than the heaviest animal in the world', 'if a place is on the land and far away from oceans, then it probably have few precipitation', 'if a person is in an uneducated state of mental illness, then the state of', 'if a book is to be read by a human being, then it should be a book written by a', 'there exist a still living aquatic mammal known as the\xa0oaxaca\xa0a', 'there exists a living aquatic mammal known as the\xa0oaxaca\xa0acicularis\xa0acovarum', 'there exists a living aquatic mammal known as the\xa0oaxaca\xa0fischeri\xa0a']","['If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.']","["": If a plant has pests, then it probably has pests.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. \n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.\n\nUber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services.

The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival.

In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.\n\n \n\nThe tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.\n\nA lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying.

You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.\n\nBecause of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”\n\nThus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.\n\nWarby Parker was launched in 2010 by four students of tswohe Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
