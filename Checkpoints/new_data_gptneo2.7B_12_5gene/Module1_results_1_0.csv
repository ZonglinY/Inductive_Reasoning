The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and may have dense or sleek fur.\nThe Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.\nPolar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.\n Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity.

It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.\nThe history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.\nThe Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. \nThe digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the\ndevelopment of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of\nbroadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of\ndigital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services.

The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. \n\nThe impact hypothesis for this extinction dates back to McLaren (1970). There is some support for extraterrestrial impact at this time. Iridium anomalies have been identified at or near the F–F (Playford et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1991) and Devonian–Carboniferous (Wang et al., 1993) boundaries. However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993). Stronger evidence for impact is present for the F–F boundary (as summarized in Wang et al., 1996), including microtektites, meteoritic elemental ratios, known impact craters, and high-energy (tsunami?) deposits. However, reported iridium enrichments at the stratotype area for the F–F boundary in southern France were not subsequently substantiated (Girard et al., 1997), and no F–F iridium anomaly was found in New York State\n\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago. \n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if an impactor (or its debris) is suspected to have caused the mass extinction, then it probably had a mass of at least one\xa0magnitude larger than the mass of the earth', 'if the iridium anomaly is at the f–f boundary, then the mass extinction has happened', 'if a site has a high-energy impact signature, then it might be a hot spot of impact', 'if an asteroid is estimated to have caused the extinction, then it probably has not caused this extinction', 'there exist a bolide impact at or near the k–pg boundary 66 million years ago', 'if an iridium anomaly is found at or near the k-pg boundary, then it most likely occurred as a result of a hypervelocity impact', 'if a meteorite is in the stratotype area for an iridium anomaly, then it most likely is an iridium-enriched meteorite', 'if the mass of a body is not more than its mass compared to its radius (including the mass of any atmosphere), then the body cannot be a planet', 'there exist a meteorite with iridium anomalies that are associated with the cretaceous-paleogene (k-pg) mass extinction', 'if a certain impact was responsible for iridium anomalies in the earth, then the impact is probably an extraterrestrial one', 'if there is an impact, then the iridium anomaly could have been deposited by the impact', 'if a man has a precise understanding of the world, then he probably is not arrogant', 'there exist a meteorite of unknown type that is heavier than the heaviest animal in the world', ""if a mass extinction is caused by a hypervelocity impact event, then the impact event should have resulted in elevated levels of iridium in the earth's crust"", 'if iridium anomalies can be found in areas not affected by any other extinction or impact event, then it is not likely that an extraterrestrial impact has been responsible', 'if iridium is found in a layer from a specific period, then there is a likelihood of impact-generated iridium', 'there exist plants, which grow in the k–pg extinction zone, which is marked by elevated concentrations of iridium', 'if a rock is pure and crystalline, then it has a characteristic melting point', 'if a species adapted to their environment through genetic changes to their skeletons, then it might have higher temperature']","['If there is an unusually high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rock strata, then a large extraterrestrial impact event (like an asteroid or comet strike) likely occurred']","["": If an impactor (or its debris) is suspected to have caused the mass extinction, then it probably had a mass of at least one\xa0magnitude larger than the mass of the Earth.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. \n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.\n\nUber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.\n\nUber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide. According to CNBC, Uber generated $12.7 billion in gross bookings in the third quarter of 2018.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior).
