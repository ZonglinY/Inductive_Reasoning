Just like people, cats can show their love through understanding and concern for others. In some instances, they have been known to risk their lives for their owners, protecting them from dangers like poisonous snakes or other hazards. Cats can also detect when their owner is upset and will often console them or, in some cases, even lick away their tears! But perhaps some of the most incredible evidence that cats do get attached to their owners is in the cases where cats have traveled miles upon miles to places they’ve never been in order to find their person.

The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes.
1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender.
2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat’s eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round.
3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes.
Venomous snakes usually have a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.
In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

Butterflies are great for your garden as they are attracted to bright flowers and need to feed on nectar. When they do this their bodies collect pollen and carry it to other plants. This helps fruits, vegetables and flowers to produce new seeds. The majority of plants need pollinators like bees and butterflies to reproduce.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer. When seeds grow near the parent plant, they may compete for water, light, and nutrients. When they are far away, they don’t compete with the parent or each other as much.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer. When seeds grow near the parent plant, they may compete for water, light, and nutrients. When they are far away, they don’t compete with the parent or each other as much. There may have been diseases or other living things that attacked the parent plant. Birds may have moved the seeds away to a safer place.

History, first and foremost, teaches us the consequences of our actions. Whether we look back to last week and decide which restaurant we go to based on our experiences, or we look back across thousands of years to determine if starting a land war in Asia is a wise idea, we can learn to make important choices based on what happened in the past. We can pick the restaurant with the fast service and get our lunch quickly, or we can decide that trying to conquer China is just a bad idea. Either way, we've learned from someone's (ours or someone else's) actions.
History also reminds us of what reality is. Sometimes we set ourselves up in boxes, making decisions based on our small worldviews. History reminds us that truth really is stranger than fiction.

The Renaissance was a period in European history which formed a bridge between the Middle Ages and the modern era. The Renaissance arrived at different countries at varying times- Italy was the first to experience this movement beginning in the 14th century while the it did not reach England until the sixteenth century. A general consensus among historians is that by the early 17th century, the Renaissance had come to an end. 

The Renaissance was a period in Europe, from the 14th to the 17th century, regarded as the cultural bridge between the Middle Ages and modern history.

104,"Although some species live in quite humid environments, most cacti live in habitats subject to at least some drought. Many live in extremely dry environments, even being found in the Atacama Desert, one of the driest places on Earth.
The outer layer of the cacti's stem usually has a tough cuticle, reinforced with waxy layers, which reduce water loss. These layers are responsible for the grayish or bluish tinge to the stem color of many cacti.
In fact, many succulents are able to thrive in dry conditions, and some are able to last up to two years without water depending on their surroundings and adaptations.
Succulent plant has waxy, hairy, or spiny outer surface to create a humid micro-habitat around the plant, which reduces air movement near the surface of the plant, and thereby reduces water loss and may create shade.
Cacti are good crops for dry areas because they convert water into biomass efficiently. 
A perennial shrub, O. ficus-indica can grow up to 5 m in height, with thick, succulent, and oblong to spatulate stems called cladodes. It has a water-repellent and sun-reflecting waxy epidermis.

Colony life has many advantages, one of the most important being increased protection for the entire group.

Ants have been demonstrated to show impressive cognitive control abilities, suppressing a dominant response (e.g., feeding) in order to carry out a secondary goal (e.g., searching for a feeding tool). 
The most complex type of social system found in primates, and in mammals as whole, is the multi-level society (also known as a hierarchical or modular society) characterizing hamadryas baboons (Figure 4), geladas, snub-nosed monkeys, and a few other mammals such as elephants.

As is the case with wild coalitions, the Zoo’s lions have a complex social hierarchy. They are strongly bonded to each other and are always nearby, or at least aware of, the others’ locations. Naming the most dominant male of the group is complicated. Hatari has always seemed to be more dominant over his brothers.
The majority of lions demonstrated novel problem-solving and learning; lions (11/12) solved the task, repeated success in multiple trials, and significantly reduced the latency to success across trials.","if a lion has the ability to learn, then it can learn to solve problems using novel solutions.","If an animal has a complex social structure, then it is likely to have developed advanced cognitive abilities.",67.7734375

Male burrowing owls have been observed to have longer wing chords than females, despite being smaller than females. Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.
Tigers have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment and stalking prey.

The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope.

The Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union[a] was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union (USSR), which resulted in the end of the existence of the country and of its federal government as a sovereign state, which in turn resulted in its constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991.

In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE.

The Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union[a] was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union (USSR), which resulted in the end of the existence of the country and of its federal government as a sovereign state, which in turn resulted in its constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991. It brought an end to General Secretary (later also President) Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and economic backslide.

110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789.

Since the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the
development of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of
broadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of
digital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards
a digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital
technologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions.","if a company has a big online presence, then they have a big online business.","If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.",59.47265625

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.
The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. 
The digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.

Since the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the
development of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of
broadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of
digital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards
a digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital
technologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions.","if there are computers at home, then the computer can be used for the creation of new knowledge.","If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.",61.23046875
110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

The social structure of America experienced radical change due to the fast-paced world the Industrial Revolution created.

Economic and social changes paralleled the political transformation of the Meiji period. Although the economy still depended on agriculture, industrialization was the primary goal of the government, which directed the development of strategic industries, transportation, and communications.

Gorbachev’s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Following the May 1990 elections, Gorbachev faced conflicting internal political pressures: Boris Yeltsin and the pluralist movement advocated democratization and rapid economic reforms while the hard-line Communist elite wanted to thwart Gorbachev’s reform agenda.

The dismantling of the Soviet Union had many long-lasting effects on the global economy and the region’s foreign trade. Its downfall increased the United States’ influence as a global power and created an opportunity for corruption and crime in Russia. It also prompted many cultural changes and social upheavals in former Soviet nations and smaller neighboring communist countries.

Gorbachev’s decision to allow elections with a multi-party system and create a presidency for the Soviet Union began a slow process of democratization that eventually destabilized Communist control and contributed to the collapse of the Soviet Union. Following the May 1990 elections, Gorbachev faced conflicting internal political pressures: Boris Yeltsin and the pluralist movement advocated democratization and rapid economic reforms while the hard-line Communist elite wanted to thwart Gorbachev’s reform agenda.

From Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.

The Tang Dynasty (618-907) witnessed the first period of florescence in the reign (627-649) of Emperor Taizong, which was called the Prosperity of Zhenguan, an era of peace and prosperity.

The Quan Tangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society.

Enron was one of the fastest-growing and supposedly innovative companies in the United States in the 1990s. However, the entire edifice was based on massive accounting and corporate fraud that eventually came to light and resulted in Enron declaring bankruptcy in December 2001—the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the world at that time.

It's been dubbed the ""diesel dupe"". In September, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that many VW cars being sold in America had a ""defeat device"" - or software - in diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested, changing the performance accordingly to improve results. The German car giant has since admitted cheating emissions tests in the US.

On 9 December 2019, Volkswagen AG was charged with 60 counts of contravening the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. On 22 January 2020, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to all charges and was fined CA$196.5 million.

One of the reasons that Uber has grown so quickly is that it doesn’t have the same overhead expenses as traditional cab companies. A less complex infrastructure also allows companies to adapt to changes more quickly, enabling them to avoid some of the problems that would otherwise hinder growth. As an example, since labor accounts for a large share of most transportation companies’ operating costs, Uber has been able to save money by hiring noncommercial drivers.

More than 20 employees have been fired from Uber as part of an internal investigation, a company spokesperson told CNBC, after a former employee alleged gender bias and sexual harassment within the start-up.

At Enron’s peak, its shares were worth $90.75; just prior to declaring bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001, they were trading at $0.26.
Enron was one of the fastest-growing and supposedly innovative companies in the United States in the 1990s. However, the entire edifice was based on massive accounting and corporate fraud that eventually came to light and resulted in Enron declaring bankruptcy in December 2001—the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the world at that time.

114,"In the period from 1843 to 1845, the English astronomer John Couch Adams analyzed all  the existing Uranus data.  In October, 1845, he proposed an answer: there is another massive planet out there.  The gravitational tug of that planet influences Uranus' orbit.  He predicted where and how big that planet must be.  British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn't take the prediction very seriously and didn't push his staff to make the necessary observations.


The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.


That discovery marked our first glimpse of the long-sought Kuiper Belt, named after Gerard Kuiper who, in 1951, proposed that a belt of icy bodies might lay beyond Neptune. It was the only way, he figured, to solve a baffling mystery about comets: Some comets loop through the solar system on periodic orbits of a half-dozen years or so.

The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H.

The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. 

The impact hypothesis for this extinction dates back to McLaren (1970). There is some support for extraterrestrial impact at this time. Iridium anomalies have been identified at or near the F–F (Playford et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1991) and Devonian–Carboniferous (Wang et al., 1993) boundaries. However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993). Stronger evidence for impact is present for the F–F boundary (as summarized in Wang et al., 1996), including microtektites, meteoritic elemental ratios, known impact craters, and high-energy (tsunami?) deposits. However, reported iridium enrichments at the stratotype area for the F–F boundary in southern France were not subsequently substantiated (Girard et al., 1997), and no F–F iridium anomaly was found in New York State

Global sales of electric cars are set to surge to yet another record this year, expanding their share of the overall car market to close to one-fifth and leading a major transformation of the auto industry that has implications for the energy sector, especially oil.

Yes, Tesla is profitable. However, the company has only become profitable in recent years, first achieving profitability in 2020 and growing to generate $12.55 billion in net profits for 2022.

Starting with just $862 million of profit in 2020, Tesla quickly grew over the next couple of years to make $5.6 billion in 2021 and more than double that by the year 2022.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. 

The company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. 

The company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide. According to CNBC, Uber generated $12.7 billion in gross bookings in the third quarter of 2018. On an adjusted pro-forma basis, it recorded a net loss of $768 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

Initially, the comprehensive school system was centrally controlled, before the eventual transfer of authority to local municipalities and teachers. The outcomes of the reforms are clear: education standards have increased in Finland, educational inequality has decreased, and Finland has a competitive economy based on its highly-educated, skilled workforce.
There is no doubt that Singapore's strong educational system contributes to its economic growth. To ensure that its workforce is highly skilled and educated, the country places a strong emphasis on education and training. Consequently, this has resulted in a highly productive, adaptable workforce that is well-suited to meet modern economic demands.


The dramatic growth of the Korean economy has also contributed significantly to the value that Koreans place on higher education. In the past 25 years, the country has realized an extraordinarily high rate of return from education investment, hovering around 10 percent.

This involves buying stocks that seem to be undervalued and selling them years later when they achieve their deserved market value.

BRRRR investing is another effective strategy made popular by Brandon Turner on Bigger Pockets. BRRRR stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance and repeat:

Buy: Buy a property at below-market value.

Rehab: Renovate and improve the property by adding value.

Rent: Rent out the property to cover the mortgage.

Refinance: Get the property reappraised, then use cash-out refinancing to secure an advantageous mortgage.

Repeat: Use the capital you recovered from the deal to invest in more properties.

With BRRRR, the idea is to capitalize on a property others may have overlooked due to its low face value or apparent lack of potential.

Jeff Bezos surely does believe in holding long-term investments. This is a common trait among the world’s top investors. Long-term investment produces gain with higher profit that usually cannot be gained in a short period. But the work philosophy behind long-term investments is the same- conduct thorough research and analysis of the companies you wish to invest in. Do your homework well and reap the benefits in the long-run. Don’t give into market conditions and withdraw your long-term investments. This will backfire and cause unprecedented losses.

Buy: Buy a property at below-market value.

Rehab: Renovate and improve the property by adding value.

Rent: Rent out the property to cover the mortgage.

Refinance: Get the property reappraised, then use cash-out refinancing to secure an advantageous mortgage.

Repeat: Use the capital you recovered from the deal to invest in more properties.

Passive income enables businesses to build their wealth and improve cash flow, leading to increased financial stability and security. In effect, passive income increases bottom line profits, saves time and expands a business’s reach.

Some of the features of the initiatives introduced by the quartet include affordability, bypassing orthodox channels by designing frames in-house, and taking cognizance of customers’ specifications.
The company which was set up under the Wharton School’s Venture Initiation Program was created to close the perceived existing lacuna between users of medicated glasses and the providers of such services. Though the idea was hatched in 2008, the business did not commence operations until two years later.


Slack was originally developed as a solution to a problem for game developers. In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.

 

The tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.

A lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying. Not only did you have to go to a grocery store or pharmacy, but usually the razors were locked on the shelf or guarded behind the checkout counter. You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.

Because of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”

Thus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.
