The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

They typically weigh between 18 and 34 kg (40 and 75 lb) and may have dense or sleek fur.\nThe Alaskan Gold Rush brought renewed interest in the use of sled dogs as transportation. Most gold camps were accessible only by dogsled in the winter. Everything that moved during the frozen season moved by dog team.\nPolar bears are superbly insulated by up to 10 cm (4 in) of adipose tissue, their hide and their fur. Polar bear fur consists of a layer of dense underfur and an outer layer of guard hairs, which appear white to tan but are actually transparent.\n Although it is the sister species of the brown bear, it has evolved to occupy a narrower ecological niche, with many body characteristics adapted for cold temperatures, for moving across snow, ice and open water, and for hunting seals, which make up most of its diet. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule"", ""Please consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Sun Tzu has stated, that there is no country that has benefitted from prolonged warfare, but Russia in 1812 won the war with attrition warfare against Napoleon. When attritional methods have worn down the enemy sufficiently to make other methods feasible, attritional methods are often complemented or even abandoned by other strategies. But in World War I military commanders on both sides relied on attrition warfare resulting in terrible casualties without a strategic result.[citation needed]\nAmong the many problems with attrition warfare are these:\nHigh death tolls — This is the primary issue. Although all wars involve casualties, attrition warfare increases the number of combatants and civilians who are killed.\nHigh costs — Attrition warfare requires a lot of resources.\nThe potential for an unstable outcome — The outcome of attrition warfare is not always clear.

Ants are considered social insects because they live in organized colonies and form complex societies. They are generally composed of three castes: the queen, the drones and the workers. Each caste has its own specific morphology and carries out specific tasks within the community. Colony life has many advantages, one of the most important being increased protection for the entire group.\n\nAnts have been demonstrated to show impressive cognitive control abilities, suppressing a dominant response (e.g., feeding) in order to carry out a secondary goal (e.g., searching for a feeding tool). \nAs is the case with wild coalitions, the Zoo’s lions have a complex social hierarchy. They are strongly bonded to each other and are always nearby, or at least aware of, the others’ locations. Naming the most dominant male of the group is complicated. Hatari has always seemed to be more dominant over his brothers.\nThe majority of lions demonstrated novel problem-solving and learning; lions (11/12) solved the task, repeated success in multiple trials, and significantly reduced the latency to success across trials. \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if a social organization has complex hierarchy, then its members probably show excellent cognitive control abilities', 'there exist an animal named monkey, which is capable of abstract reasoning through disjunctive syllogisms', 'if a colony of insects has a complex social structure and it can control its own behavior, then it can be said that it is a complex social organism', 'if an animal is always together with the same other animals, it might be their companion', 'if a group of animals can solve a problem, then they might have good cognitive abilities', 'there exist an animal that is more dominant than his siblings, and a zoo that contains an animal that is more dominant than his siblings', 'if a species is social, and has complex social system, then it is mammal', 'if an animal is smart, then it might be able to solve a problem', 'if an animal does not have the ability to suppress a dominant response to carry out a secondary goal, then it probably cannot think creatively', 'there exist a colony of ants, which can suppress a dominant response (e', 'if a species lives in social group and has a complex social hierarchy, then it is primate', 'if a certain species is known to solve a certain type of problem, then this species might be able to solve this problem as well', 'if an animal is part of a society, then he probably does not have a precise understanding about the world and might encounter with failure', 'if a social animal lives in a society, then he', 'there exist a community of lions who are strongly bonded to each other and are always nearby, or at least aware of, the others’ locations', 'if a group of animals has a complex social hierarchy, then they might be able to demonstrate a higher cognitive ability', 'if a certain number of lions are in the same area, then they might be more likely to cooperate', 'if an animal has a complex social hierarchy, then it probably needs a cognitive ability to control such a hierarchy', 'there exist animals that live in social groups', 'if an animal has a complex social organization and solves problems, then it is smart', 'if a primate is highly social, then it probably has complex social hierarchy', 'if a primate has a complex social hierarchy, then it might be socially dominant']","['If an animal has a complex social structure, then it is likely to have developed advanced cognitive abilities.']","["": If a social organization has complex hierarchy, then its members probably show excellent cognitive control abilities.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.\nThe eyes in the ox and the sheep are placed on the sides\nof the head. \nSheep eat grasses, plants, legumes, and forbs, since they are strict herbivores. Interestingly, sheep can survive solely on pasture grass, especially ryegrass and timothy, making them self-sufficient livestock throughout the warmer months.\nTigers have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment and stalking prey.\nWhat does a tiger eat?

It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.\n\nThe printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.\n\nThis allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.\n\nIt also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.\n\nPrinting also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.\n\nPrinting revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.\nThe history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.\nThe Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. \nThe digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the\ndevelopment of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of\nbroadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of\ndigital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services.

British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn\'t take the prediction very seriously and didn\'t push his staff to make the necessary observations.\n\n\nThe existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.\n\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule']","['if a man finds a planet, then he must spend much time to understand it', 'there exist a planet, which is heavier than the heaviest known animal', 'if a planet is invisible, then it might be the ninth planet', 'if an unknown planet is proposed, then it might be found', 'if the existence of a planet was postulated, then it probably has a small mass', 'there exist a planet named neptune, which is located between uranus and the earth', 'if the planet has a wobbling effect in the orbit of uranus and neptune, then the planet is the ninth planet in the solar system', ""if a planet is named after a person, then the planet is probably in its star's habitable zone"", 'if there is a planet in the sky, then we should consider it', 'there exist a known planet that was only recently discovered, which was named after percival lowell', 'if a planet is found in orbit around the sun, then it is the ninth planet in the solar system', 'if an object orbits around the sun, then it is a planet', 'if a planet is found, then there must be some other planets out there', 'if a planet orbits around a star, then it might influence the orbit of another planet', 'there exist a plant that can be found in desert', 'if an object is distant from the planets, then it might be a planet', ""if a planet is far away, then its gravitational pull will be very weak and it can't affect very much its planets"", 'there exist an planet that is smaller than pluto', 'if an object with mass is capable of gravitation, then it probably is a planet', 'if a comet has a period of a half-dozen years, then it might be a short-period comet']","['If a celestial body is observed to have an irregular orbit, then it often indicates the gravitational influence of another, as-yet-undiscovered celestial body.']","["": If a man finds a planet, then he must spend much time to understand it.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The “guest star” they observed was actually a supernova explosion, which gave rise to the Crab Nebula, a six-light-year-wide remnant of the violent event.\n\n\nThe more reliable contemporary reports state that the new star itself burst forth soon after November 2, and by November 11 it was already brighter than Jupiter. Around November 16, 1572, it reached its peak brightness at about magnitude −4.0, with some descriptions giving it as equal to Venus when that planet was at its brightest. Contrarily, Brahe described the supernova as ""brighter than Venus"". The supernova remained visible to the naked eye into early 1574, gradually fading until it disappeared from view.\n\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule']","['if a man is arrogant, then he might lose his vision and see only his own point of view', 'there exist a star named sun in the solar system, which is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth', 'if a star is brighter than venus, then it might be a supernova', 'if an exploding star is bright, then it might can be seen by naked eye', 'if a man is arrogant, then he might not have the right knowledge of the world and he might encounter with failure', 'there exist a star, named sun, in the solar system, which is by far the most important source of energy for life on earth', 'if a star is visible to the naked eye, then it might be a supernova', 'if a supernova becomes more bright than a planet, then it should be very bright', 'if a star is visible for a while, then it might be a supernova', 'there exist a star which is currently visible during the daytime', 'if a star explodes and is visible to the naked eye, then it might be a supernova', 'if a supernova was as bright as the moon, then it might be seen by naked eye', 'if a man encounters with a great supernova explosion, then he might encounter with failure', 'there exist a supernova in the past that was brighter than venus', 'if a star suddenly appears on the sky and reaches the maximum brightness, then it might be a supernova', 'if a planet is visible, then it probably has a big size', 'if a man is a witness of an event that he is not expected to be present at, then he might not be able to face it and might encounter with failure', 'there exist a star in the sky which was observed for several months in the daytime sky, which was actually a supernova explosion', 'if a star is visible in the daytime sky, then it might be a supernova', 'if a star is not visible in the daytime sky, then it might be very bright']","['If a star is observed to suddenly increase in brightness, then it often indicates a stellar explosion or supernova event, which can lead to the creation of elements heavier than iron.']","["": If a man is arrogant, then he might lose his vision and see only his own point of view.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The iridium was probably not in the microtektites but deposited simultaneously with them; this could occur if the iridium was deposited from a dust cloud resulting from a bolide impact, as suggested for the anomaly associated with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary. \n\nThe impact hypothesis for this extinction dates back to McLaren (1970). There is some support for extraterrestrial impact at this time. Iridium anomalies have been identified at or near the F–F (Playford et al., 1984; Wang et al., 1991) and Devonian–Carboniferous (Wang et al., 1993) boundaries. However, the Devonian–Carboniferous anomaly has no supporting evidence for impact, and elemental ratios are not chondritic. Redox changes have been invoked to explain this anomaly (Wang et al., 1993). Stronger evidence for impact is present for the F–F boundary (as summarized in Wang et al., 1996), including microtektites, meteoritic elemental ratios, known impact craters, and high-energy (tsunami?) deposits. However, reported iridium enrichments at the stratotype area for the F–F boundary in southern France were not subsequently substantiated (Girard et al., 1997), and no F–F iridium anomaly was found in New York State\n\nThe Cretaceous-Paleogene (K-Pg) mass extinction is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago. \n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if a mass extinction has occurred, then it probably was caused by an impact', 'there exist at least one impact crater on the earth that has evidence of an extraterrestrial impact and a microtektite layer coinciding with it', 'if a mass extinction has a hypervelocity impact event, then it is caused by an asteroid', 'if a place has high iridium content, then it might be a crater, which caused extinction', 'if a man has a good understanding about the world, then he might encounter with failure', 'there exist a cretaceous-paleogene mass extinction, which is marked globally by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event 66 million years ago', 'if an iridium anomaly exists in a certain stratum, then an impact occurred', 'if an extraterrestrial object collides with a planet, then a lot of debris will be produced', 'if an extraterrestrial object collides with a planet, then a lot of debris will be', 'if a mass extinction is marked by elevated iridium, then it probably was caused by an extraterrestrial impact', 'if a planet is close to another planet, then the planet may have been affected by the impact of the other planet', 'if a body is hypervelocity, then it probably might be a meteor or an asteroid', 'if a man is arrogant, then he probably does not have a precise understanding about the world and might encounter with failure', 'there exist iridium anomaly at the cretaceous-paleogene boundary', 'if a material is extraterrestrial, then it probably have a hypervelocity impact', 'if there are iridium anomalies, then the extinction might be caused by impact', 'if the iridium anomaly is seen, then the impact hypothesis for this extinction is likely', 'there exist a global extinction event 66 million years ago, which is marked by elevated concentrations of iridium, emplaced by a hypervelocity impact event', 'if the iridium is enriched in the site of the impact and the iridium is an indication of the impact, then it might have occurred a hypervelocity impact event', 'if there is an iridium anomaly at a time when a mass extinction occurs, then it might be a result of an impact']","['If there is an unusually high concentration of iridium in sedimentary rock strata, then a large extraterrestrial impact event (like an asteroid or comet strike) likely occurred']","["": If a mass extinction has occurred, then it probably was caused by an impact.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. \n\nThe company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.\n\nUber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.\n\nUber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide. According to CNBC, Uber generated $12.7 billion in gross bookings in the third quarter of 2018.

This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival.

The Spotify model focuses on decentralizing decision making and transferring that responsibility to Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds.\n\nIn W. L. Gore & Associates, there is no hierarchy or direct manager -not even a job title- that has the full authority. Because of the lattice organizational structure, even the decision-making is decentralized. As mentioned in the Amazon.com section of the paper, coordination has three mechanisms: rules and directives, mutual adjustment, and routines (GRANT, 2019, p. 137). However, rules and directives, and routines do notably in Gore's case. The only mutual adjustment could be applied. Employees coordinate their acts without order or schedules. The mutual adjustment takes place in leaderless organizations (GRANT, 2019, p. 137). As mentioned in the case, employees can choose any project or team that they feel comfortable with as long as they commit to it and finish what they start as peer to peer.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule""]","['if an organization does not have a hierarchy, then it is likely to have a leaderless organization', 'there exist an organization which consists of employees who are allowed to choose any project or team they feel comfortable with as long as they commit to it and finish what they start as peer to peer', 'if you have a freedom to do whatever you want, then you have freedom to choose whatever you want', 'if the work is too hard, or not fun, or tedious, then it might need someone to coordinate it', 'if a decentralized organization does not have rules, then they probably have no decision-making authority', 'there exist a company that has no hierarchy or direct manager, even a job title- that has the full authority', ""do not include 'if ' and 'then' in generation"", 'if there is no boss or supervisor, then there might be less coordination and mutual adjustment', 'if the leader is not present or does not make a decision, then the employee will have to make a decision and take responsibility for it', 'if there is no hierarchy, then there is no manager', 'if a person works as a self-led project team, then the team might have a higher level of efficiency', 'if a place is mountainous or has large rivers, then it probably can help troops to better defend from their enemies', 'if a person is not allowed to do something, then he or she probably will not do it', 'there exist a team that is able to work in self-management, which are responsible for completing the work that they are doing in the way that they feel is the most appropriate', 'if there is a group of people working together without any bosses or leaders, then they can coordinate and synchronize their acts, work together to finish the project', 'if a team works together with mutual adjustment, then it will make better decisions than a team who just follows the leader', 'if there is no manager, then decision making is decentralized', 'there exist a decentralized organization in which there is no hierarchy', 'if an organization allows members to pursue their passions, then it probably allows employees to create their own workgroups', 'if an employee can get involved in more projects, he/she can be a happier employee']","['If a small company can create a decentralized decision-making system, empowering lower-level employees and frontline workers with the authority to solve problems and make important decisions, then they can be more agile, responsive to changing conditions, and enhance employee engagement, leading to the potential for long-term success.']","["": If an organization does not have a hierarchy, then it is likely to have a leaderless organization.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.
