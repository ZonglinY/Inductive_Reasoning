The Indo-Australian plate continues to be driven horizontally below the Tibetan Plateau, which forces the plateau to move upwards.\nThe Chota Nagpur Plateau is a continental plateau—an extensive area of land thrust above the general land. The plateau has been formed by continental uplift from forces acting deep inside the earth, caused by the collision between the Deccan Plate and the Eurasian continent. \nDuring the\xa0Pennsylvanian\xa0period the Ozark Plateau was uplifted as a result of the\xa0Ouachita orogeny. During the late Paleozoic the deep ocean basin that existed in central and southern Arkansas was lifted when South America collided with North America, creating the folded Ouachita Mountains and uplifting the Ozark plateau to the north.\n \nRule template: if __, then __.\nRule: If two plates collide, then a plateau might form.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Furthermore, owls have been observed to be roughly the same size as their prey. This has also been observed in other predatory birds, which suggests that owls with smaller bodies and long wing chords have been selected for because of the increased agility and speed that allows them to catch their prey.\nThe eyes in the ox and the sheep are placed on the sides\nof the head. \nSheep eat grasses, plants, legumes, and forbs, since they are strict herbivores. Interestingly, sheep can survive solely on pasture grass, especially ryegrass and timothy, making them self-sufficient livestock throughout the warmer months.\nTigers have forward facing eyes rather than one on each side of their head. This provides binocular vision because each eye's field of vision overlaps creating a three dimensional image. Binocular vision enables them to accurately assess distances and depth which is extremely useful for maneuvering within their complex environment and stalking prey.\nWhat does a tiger eat?

It brought an end to General Secretary (later also President) Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and economic backslide.\n\nThe fall of the Roman Empire ushered in a time of great change throughout Europe, and with it, what is referred to by some as the Dark Ages, a five-hundred-year time period from roughly 500 CE to 1000 CE. \nThe cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope. A church and state bond began and continued throughout the entirety of the Dark Ages.\nFrench Revolution, also called Revolution of 1789, revolutionary movement that shook France between 1787 and 1799 and reached its first climax there in 1789—hence the conventional term “Revolution of 1789,” denoting the end of the ancien régime in France and serving also to distinguish that event from the later French revolutions of 1830 and 1848.\n\nThe Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.\n  \nRule template:  if __, then __. \nRule""]","['if the country is affected by wars, then its economy will decline', 'there exist an event that caused a series of changes that ushered in a time of great change', 'if a person who have high iq will be more likely to have good performance in the future', 'if a country is located in the north hemisphere and in a landlocked region, then that country is either russia or canada', 'if a country is located in the north hemisphere and in a', 'if the cause of the dark ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the roman empire, then the result will be a dark time period', 'if a country was divided into two parts, then it might have a dark age', 'there exist a series of events related to the downfall of the roman empire which led to the demise of the western roman empire', 'if a people group is not willing to work hard and sacrifice in order to achieve greatness, then there is a very high chance of failure', 'if something has happened, then it is a revolution or a war', 'if a city is founded, then it might have a revolution, a reign of terror and wars', 'there exist events that result in the death of tens of thousands', 'if a place has a great change, then it might have great impact over its surroundings', 'if a country is conquered or a political party is taken over, then it might has a revolution', 'if two events are closely linked, then a great change in society might be caused', 'there exist events of a time period in which the roman empire fell, which then resulted in a series of events that caused the downfall of the roman empire', 'if a political conflict is very severe and the factions are very divided, then more people will be killed in the conflict', 'if two groups of people are in a conflict, then the more radical group will win over the moderate group', 'if a state collapses, then there will be great change', 'there exist a moment in history that marked the downfall of the roman empire', 'if a country is in a state of disintegration and a period of time where political and economic reforms are tried in an attempt to stop a state of stalemate and economic backslide, then the country is most likely to be in a dark age', 'if two different political factions are fighting, then there will be a lot of people dying']","['If a socio-political structure is abruptly dismantled without the establishment of a robust alternative system, then it often leads to a period of chaos, violence, or power vacuum in the society']","["": If the country is affected by wars, then its economy will decline.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

Their ability to submerge and to surprise enemies led to massive casualties: Germany and Austria-Hungary sank almost 5,000 merchant ships during World War I, killing approximately 15,000 Allied sailors. The Treaty of Versailles required the Germans to surrender and break up their U-boat fleet, but German naval commanders had learned the value of submarine warfare and continued to improve this technology in peacetime years. German U-boats returned to North Carolina during World War II with a vengeance, leaving even more wrecks off the coast.\n\n\nThe legacy of the Manhattan Project is immense. The advent of nuclear weapons not only helped bring an end to the Second World War but ushered in the atomic age and determined how the next war, the Cold War, would be fought. In addition, the Manhattan Project became the organizational model behind the remarkable achievements of American ""big science"" during the second half of the twentieth century.

It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.\n\nThe printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.\n\nThis allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.\n\nIt also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.\n\nPrinting also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.\n\nPrinting revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.\nThe history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.\nThe Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789. \nThe digital revolution is without a doubt the most significant event in information dissemination since Gutenberg’s printing press and arguably marks a much bigger shift in human communication. This chapter discusses the impact of the digital revolution on scholarly publishing and professional communication thus far and describes the key trends and technologies shaping the future of the industry. These include evolving online publishing platforms, Web 2.0 technologies that use audience participation and network intelligence, mobile technologies that enable information professionals to access information anywhere, semantic technologies that transform how we discover information, and workflow integrations that channel the right information to the right individual at the right time.\n\nSince the late 1980s, the digital revolution has transformed the economy and society. First came the\ndevelopment of a connected economy, characterized by mass take-up of the Internet and the roll-out of\nbroadband networks. This was followed by the development of a digital economy via the increasing use of\ndigital platforms as business models for the supply of goods and services. Now the movement is towards\na digitalized economy whose production and consumption models are based on the incorporation of digital\ntechnologies in all economic, social and environmental dimensions.  \nRule template:  if __, then __. \nRule""]","['if a society or an economy goes through a digital revolution, then it will have a massive impact on human communication and information dissemination', 'if a person can access to the world and can write the history of science during the age of reason, then he might have better understanding about human society', 'if a person or entity has access to the internet, then it is probably a part of digital revolution', 'if the history of science is about print, then digital is the new print', 'if there exists an event that occurs in 1492, then there exist an event that occurs in 1992', 'if there exists an event that occurs in 1492, then there exist an event that occurs', 'if the digital revolution is about connectivity, then it probably changes the way people think and communicate', 'if a thing is mass-produced or mass-consumed, then it has lower price', 'if the printing revolution occurred, then a digital revolution occurred', 'there exist two things, a digital revolution and a printing revolution', ""if an event is on digitalization, then it probably is a massive event and changes human's communication"", 'if a revolution has an impact on the economy, then it might has a positive effect', 'if a revolution changes the economy or society, then the digital revolution changes the economy and society', 'there exist digital revolutions that can affect the economy and society', 'if the development of a connected economy and the incorporation of digital technology in all dimensions, then digital economy would emerge', 'if the digital revolution is a major change in economy and society, then it will have a major impact on business and the society', 'if a technological revolution changes the economy and society, then it probably leads to an information revolution', 'there exist the digital revolution, which transformed economy and society', 'if the digital revolution happened and changed the economy and society, then we might be able to see more change happen to the economy and society', 'if the internet has been invented, then it has more benefits']","['If a society experiences an unexpected increase in access to information or knowledge, then it will undergo substantial social and political transformations.']","[': If a society or an economy goes through a digital revolution, then it will have a massive impact on human communication and information dissemination.\n\n\n\n<#list_of_scientific_topics>\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#\n#', ""There exist two or more revolutions.\nPlease consider the following facts and the given rule template, try to generate a rule that satisfies the rule template and the given facts.

The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.\n\nFrom Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.\n\nIf the Enlightenment can be defined as an emancipatory call for reason, a concern for more analytic and systematic explanations, or a claim to greater freedom, happiness and equality for mankind, then eighteenth-century economic thought as a specific inquiry into principles or laws governing the economy of a civil society, whether named science of trade or political economy, takes part in this vision.

However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.\n\nNetflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior).

To ensure that its workforce is highly skilled and educated, the country places a strong emphasis on education and training. Consequently, this has resulted in a highly productive, adaptable workforce that is well-suited to meet modern economic demands.\n\n\nThe dramatic growth of the Korean economy has also contributed significantly to the value that Koreans place on higher education. In the past 25 years, the country has realized an extraordinarily high rate of return from education investment, hovering around 10 percent. \nThis high educational level of the labor force supports the claim that\na trained workforce, together with a more professional workforce, has\ncontributed to improving productivity and enhancing the industrial structure\nin Korea.\nImitating public policies is obviously wrong. For other countries to copy what Finland is doing today on education could be a mistake. Among many reasons, the Finnish system relies on high-quality, extremely well-trained and committed teachers for it to work. Since most education systems lack this critical ingredient, it is not possible to directly implement current Finnish practices.\nFree comprehensive schools for children between seven and sixteen replaced the two-tier system of grammar schools and civic schools. Initially, the comprehensive school system was centrally controlled, before the eventual transfer of authority to local municipalities and teachers.

In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.\n\n \n\nThe tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.\n\nA lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying. Not only did you have to go to a grocery store or pharmacy, but usually the razors were locked on the shelf or guarded behind the checkout counter. You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.\n\nBecause of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”\n\nThus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.\n\nWarby Parker was launched in 2010 by four students of tswohe Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania.
