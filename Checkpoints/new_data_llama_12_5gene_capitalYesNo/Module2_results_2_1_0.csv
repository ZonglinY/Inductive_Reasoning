Just like people, cats can show their love through understanding and concern for others. In some instances, they have been known to risk their lives for their owners, protecting them from dangers like poisonous snakes or other hazards. Cats can also detect when their owner is upset and will often console them or, in some cases, even lick away their tears! But perhaps some of the most incredible evidence that cats do get attached to their owners is in the cases where cats have traveled miles upon miles to places they’ve never been in order to find their person.

The temperature of the eggs' micro-environment can determine the sex of the hatched young: low temperature incubation produces more females while higher temperatures produce more males.","if a reptile has more sex chromosomes, then it might have more female and less male.","If a reptile lays egg under different temperature, then the gender of the eggs probably varies accordingly to the temperature.",45.7275390625

The copperhead and the rattlesnake share three characteristics that can quickly distinguish them from other non-venomous snakes.
1. Broad, flattened, arrow shaped heads with narrow necks, while the heads of non venomous snakes are long and slender.
2. The venomous snakes have elliptical shaped eyes similar to a cat’s eye, while non venomous snakes eyes are round.
3. Sensory pits located near the nostrils are also unique to venomous snakes.
Venomous snakes usually have a triangular (wide at the back and attached to a narrow neck) or 'spade-shaped' head.
In Kentucky, the black part in the center of the eye (pupil) of harmless snakes is round. Venomous snakes have egg-shaped or cat-like (elliptical) pupils.
Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

Venomous snakes in Kentucky have a very conspicuous sensory area or pit (hence the name 'pit viper') on each side of the head. The pit looks somewhat like a nostril and helps the snake locate warm-bodied prey. It is located about midway and slightly below the eye and nostril. Non-venomous snakes do not have pits.

Venomous snakes have distinct heads. While non-venomous snakes have a rounded head, venomous snakes have a more triangular-shaped head. The shape of a venomous snake's head may deter predators. However, some non-venomous snakes can mimic the triangular shape of non-venomous snakes by flattening their heads.

When birds eat fruits and berries, they move seeds away from the parent plant. Sometimes they do this by carrying a large fruit away to eat it. Sometimes they do this by eating small fruits and berries whole. When they defecate (poop) in another place, the seeds are also covered with fertilizer. When seeds grow near the parent plant, they may compete for water, light, and nutrients. When they are far away, they don’t compete with the parent or each other as much. There may have been diseases or other living things that attacked the parent plant. Birds may have moved the seeds away to a safer place.

However, reports of poisoning are rare, due to its striking appearance and at times putrid smell, which discourage casual experimentation.
The squat, brightly coloured fruiting bodies are often massive and imposing, with a pale, dull-coloured velvety cap up to 30 cm (12 in), extraordinarily 40 cm (16 in), very rarely 50 cm (20 in) across, yellow to orange-red pores and a bulbous red-patterned stem.
Russula emetica, commonly known as the sickener, emetic russula, or vomiting russula, is a basidiomycete mushroom, and the type species of the genus Russula. It has a red, convex to flat cap up to 8.5 cm (3.3 in) in diameter, with a cuticle that can be peeled off almost to the centre.
The mushroom's common names refer to the gastrointestinal distress they cause when consumed raw. The flesh is extremely peppery, but this offensive taste, along with its toxicity, can be removed by parboiling or pickling.

Flowers produce nectar as a reward for pollination, the process of transferring pollen from flower to flower. Many flowers need pollen to reproduce. However, because plants are immobile they need help with pollen transfer. An animal that transfers pollen from flower to flower is called a pollinator. By rewarding pollinators with nectar, the animals inadvertently help the plant with pollen transfer. This monarch, covered with sticky grains of pollen, is serving as a pollinator.
","if a plant produces a flower or has a pollinator, then it probably has seeds.","If a plant has flowers with nectar or has fruit with sweet juice, it probably can benefit from animals' help on its reproduction.",55.078125

Mars is a terrestrial planet with a thin atmosphere, having surface features reminiscent both of the impact craters of the Moon and the valleys, deserts, and polar ice caps of Earth.

In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire.

The Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union[a] was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union (USSR), which resulted in the end of the existence of the country and of its federal government as a sovereign state, which in turn resulted in its constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991.

The Reign of Terror (September 5, 1793 – July 28, 1794), also known as The Terror, was a period of violence during the French Revolution incited by conflict between two rival political factions, the Girondins (moderate republicans) and the Jacobins (radical republicans), and marked by mass executions of “the enemies of the revolution.” The death toll ranged in the tens of thousands, with 16,594 executed by guillotine and another 25,000 in summary executions across France.

The dissolution of the Soviet Union[a] was the process of internal disintegration within the Soviet Union (USSR), which resulted in the end of the existence of the country and of its federal government as a sovereign state, which in turn resulted in its constituent republics gaining full independence on 26 December 1991. It brought an end to General Secretary (later also President) Mikhail Gorbachev's effort to reform the Soviet political and economic system in an attempt to stop a period of political stalemate and economic backslide.

107,"The fall of the Roman Empire ushered in a time of great change throughout Europe, and with it, what is referred to by some as the Dark Ages, a five-hundred-year time period from roughly 500 CE to 1000 CE. 
The cause of the Dark Ages is associated with a series of events related to the downfall of the Roman Empire. In 395 CE after the death of Emperor Theodosius, the Roman Empire was divided in half. In 410 CE, the Visigoths entered Rome and destroyed much of the city, to the extent that it was never the same. This continued through 455 CE. In 476 CE Odoacer, a German ruler, removed Emperor Romulus Augustulus and made himself the king of Italy. This moment in history is cited as the demise of the Western Roman Empire. In 481 CE, Clovis took the throne in France and in 496 CE converted to Christianity. This led to forming a relationship with the Pope.

The damage inflicted by U-boats during World War I was powerful. Their ability to submerge and to surprise enemies led to massive casualties: Germany and Austria-Hungary sank almost 5,000 merchant ships during World War I, killing approximately 15,000 Allied sailors. The Treaty of Versailles required the Germans to surrender and break up their U-boat fleet, but German naval commanders had learned the value of submarine warfare and continued to improve this technology in peacetime years. German U-boats returned to North Carolina during World War II with a vengeance, leaving even more wrecks off the coast.

109,"The Islamic Golden Age lasted from the 8th to the 13th century and was characterized by progress in science, mathematics, astronomy, medicine, and philosophy.

The era of the Scientific Renaissance focused to some degree on recovering the knowledge of the ancients and is considered to have culminated in Isaac Newton's 1687 publication Principia which formulated the laws of motion and universal gravitation, thereby completing the synthesis of a new cosmology. The subsequent Age of Enlightenment saw the concept of a scientific revolution emerge in the 18th-century work of Jean Sylvain Bailly, who described a two-stage process of sweeping away the old and establishing the new. There continues to be scholarly engagement regarding the boundaries of the Scientific Revolution and its chronology.


Investments in research, development, institutional and technical support and complementary assets that facilitate the timely identification, adoption and diffusion of new scientific and technological knowledge throughout the national economy. These include investments in work force training, travel budgets for resident research and advanced production personnel, development or use of information data bases and networks and provision of technical or industrial extension services.

110,"The printing revolution is a term used to describe the massive change in society that occurred with the invention of the printing press. It brought about a rapid change in literature and lowered the cost of books so that more people could own them.

The printing press was the first device that printed with movable type to produce large quantities of books quickly.

This allowed common people who couldn’t read or write to have access to written information. It also allowed for the faster circulation of pamphlets, which helped spread ideas about religion, politics, and science.

It also led to the general population, especially women, becoming more interested in reading and writing.

Printing also played an important role in the discovery of the New World. In 1492, Christopher Columbus’ first diary of the discovery of America was published.

Printing revolutionized society because it gave people access to ideas and to the world. It gave them the opportunity to learn and, later, the chance to express their opinions.
The history of science during the Age of Enlightenment traces developments in science and technology during the Age of Reason, when Enlightenment ideas and ideals were being disseminated across Europe and North America. Generally, the period spans from the final days of the 16th and 17th-century Scientific Revolution until roughly the 19th century, after the French Revolution (1789) and the Napoleonic era (1799–1815). The scientific revolution saw the creation of the first scientific societies, the rise of Copernicanism, and the displacement of Aristotelian natural philosophy and Galen's ancient medical doctrine. By the 18th century, scientific authority began to displace religious authority, and the disciplines of alchemy and astrology lost scientific credibility.

112,"A “golden age” is a time of peace, prosperity, and happiness, and often occurs when cultural activities such as art or writing reach a peak. The Greek city-state of Athens reached its Golden Age between 480 - 404 BCE. This era is also referred to as the Age of Pericles, for the Athenian statesman who led the city from 461 to 429 BCE.

From Thales, who is often considered the first Western philosopher, to the Stoics and Skeptics, ancient Greek philosophy opened the doors to a particular way of thinking that provided the roots for the Western intellectual tradition. Here, there is often an explicit preference for the life of reason and rational thought. We find proto-scientific explanations of the natural world in the Milesian thinkers, and we hear Democritus posit atoms—indivisible and invisible units—as the basic stuff of all matter. With Socrates comes a sustained inquiry into ethical matters—an orientation towards human living and the best life for human beings. With Plato comes one of the most creative and flexible ways of doing philosophy, which some have since attempted to imitate by writing philosophical dialogues covering topics still of interest today in ethics, political thought, metaphysics, and epistemology. Plato’s student, Aristotle, was one of the most prolific of ancient authors. He wrote treatises on each of these topics, as well as on the investigation of the natural world, including the composition of animals. The Hellenists—Epicurus, the Cynics, the Stoics, and the Skeptics—developed schools or movements devoted to distinct philosophical lifestyles, each with reason at its foundation.

The Tang Dynasty (618-907) witnessed the first period of florescence in the reign (627-649) of Emperor Taizong, which was called the Prosperity of Zhenguan, an era of peace and prosperity.

The Quan Tangshi includes over 48,900 poems written by over 2,200 authors. During the Tang dynasty, poetry continued to be an important part of social life at all levels of society. Scholars were required to master poetry for the civil service exams, but the art was theoretically available to everyone. This led to a large record of poetry and poets, a partial record of which survives today. The two most famous poets of the period were Li Bai and Du Fu. 
If the Enlightenment can be defined as an emancipatory call for reason, a concern for more analytic and systematic explanations, or a claim to greater freedom, happiness and equality for mankind, then eighteenth-century economic thought as a specific inquiry into principles or laws governing the economy of a civil society, whether named science of trade or political economy, takes part in this vision. It might be said that economic thought contributed to the promotion of a civil and commercial culture insofar as it sought to achieve peace and prosperity within the nation and between nations. It is in this sense that in the eighteenth-century Europe science of trade and political economy were regarded as new and hopeful sciences.

The Enlightenment is often associated with its political revolutions and ideals, especially the French Revolution of 1789.","if a period of prosperity was associated with a particular dynasty, then there might be a specific rule that describes the characteristics of such prosperity.","If a nation or culture experiences an extended period of peace and prosperity, then a significant movement of introspection and philosophical innovation is likely to follow.",44.189453125

113,"The story of Enron Corp. depicts a company that reached dramatic heights only to face a dizzying fall. The fated company’s collapse affected thousands of employees and shook Wall Street to its core. At Enron’s peak, its shares were worth $90.75; just prior to declaring bankruptcy on Dec. 2, 2001, they were trading at $0.26.
Enron was one of the fastest-growing and supposedly innovative companies in the United States in the 1990s. However, the entire edifice was based on massive accounting and corporate fraud that eventually came to light and resulted in Enron declaring bankruptcy in December 2001—the biggest corporate bankruptcy in the world at that time.

It's been dubbed the ""diesel dupe"". In September, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) found that many VW cars being sold in America had a ""defeat device"" - or software - in diesel engines that could detect when they were being tested, changing the performance accordingly to improve results. The German car giant has since admitted cheating emissions tests in the US.

On 9 December 2019, Volkswagen AG was charged with 60 counts of contravening the Canadian Environmental Protection Act, 1999. On 22 January 2020, Volkswagen pleaded guilty to all charges and was fined CA$196.5 million.

One of the reasons that Uber has grown so quickly is that it doesn’t have the same overhead expenses as traditional cab companies. A less complex infrastructure also allows companies to adapt to changes more quickly, enabling them to avoid some of the problems that would otherwise hinder growth. As an example, since labor accounts for a large share of most transportation companies’ operating costs, Uber has been able to save money by hiring noncommercial drivers.

More than 20 employees have been fired from Uber as part of an internal investigation, a company spokesperson told CNBC, after a former employee alleged gender bias and sexual harassment within the start-up.

He predicted where and how big that planet must be.  British Astronomer Royal, Sir George Airy, didn't take the prediction very seriously and didn't push his staff to make the necessary observations.


The existence of an unknown ninth planet was first proposed by Percival Lowell, who theorized that wobbles in the orbits of Uranus and Neptune were caused by the gravitational pull of an unknown planetary body. Lowell calculated the approximate location of the hypothesized ninth planet and searched for more than a decade without success. However, in 1929, using the calculations of Lowell and W.H. Pickering as a guide, the search for Pluto was resumed at the Lowell Observatory in Arizona. On February 18, 1930, Tombaugh discovered the tiny, distant planet by use of a new astronomic technique of photographic plates combined with a blink microscope. His finding was confirmed by several other astronomers, and on March 13, 1930—the anniversary of Lowell’s birth and of William Herschel’s discovery of Uranus—the discovery of Pluto was publicly announced.

The more reliable contemporary reports state that the new star itself burst forth soon after November 2, and by November 11 it was already brighter than Jupiter. Around November 16, 1572, it reached its peak brightness at about magnitude −4.0, with some descriptions giving it as equal to Venus when that planet was at its brightest. Contrarily, Brahe described the supernova as ""brighter than Venus"". The supernova remained visible to the naked eye into early 1574, gradually fading until it disappeared from view.


Three decades ago, astronomers spotted one of the brightest exploding stars in more than 400 years. The titanic supernova, called Supernova 1987A (SN 1987A), blazed with the power of 100 million suns for several months following its discovery on Feb. 23, 1987.

The New Liberty Standard Exchange recorded the first exchange of Bitcoin for dollars in late 2009. Users on the BitcoinTalk forum traded 5,050 bitcoins for $5.02 via PayPal, making the first price mediated through an exchange a bargain basement price of $0.00099 per bitcoin. In other words, the price was about one-tenth of one cent.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million. This was a major milestone for the company, which had been founded only six years prior and had yet to generate any profits ($20.95 million net loss the year prior). The timing couldn’t have been better; this happened shortly before digital streaming took off, allowing Netflix to capitalize on the market and serve as an early mover in what would become a dominant industry sector. 

The company was founded in 2010 by Neil Blumenthal, Andrew Hunt, David Gilboa, and Jeffrey Raider. Their problem: Glasses were too expensive. At that time, the eyewear industry was dominated by a single company that dictated prices. Moreover, many people worldwide who were in need of glasses could not afford them. Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide. According to CNBC, Uber generated $12.7 billion in gross bookings in the third quarter of 2018. On an adjusted pro-forma basis, it recorded a net loss of $768 million in the fourth quarter of 2018.

However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival.

Therefore they started Warby Parker in order to create a cheaper alternative and cooperate with organizations to help poor people. Warby Parker was called the Netflix of eyewear. In 2015 the value of the company was $1.2 billion.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide.

Uber is successful because it found some very specific needs that were not being met by traditional taxis or car services. As its website says quite succinctly, these three needs are: request from anywhere, ride with style and convenience, and hassle-free payment. These could also be called DIFFERENTIATORS. As a plus, for Barb (and for other women), these also translate to added safety.

Uber is one of the most successful ride-sharing companies in the United States. It has a presence in more than 10,000 cities worldwide.

119,"The rise of Netflix exposed a couple of weaknesses in the traditional video rental business model. First is customer convenience. At its peak, Blockbuster had stores in every major town across the country. This made video rental process reasonably convenient to most customers. However, Netflix took the concept of customer convenience one step further by leveraging the use of a customer’s mailbox – thereby ensuring that the customer did not have to leave home to rent or return movies watched. The sheer number of stores that Blockbuster had to maintain in order to provide convenience added to the infrastructure costs associated with the business, something that an upstart like Netflix would not have to contend with. This allowed Netflix to gain a huge operational and cost advantage over its brick and mortar rival. Although Netflix initially received a lot of negative feedback over long delivery times, as it opened more warehouses (rather stores) and optimized its operations by working with the USPS to reduce delivery times, it was able gain a lot of positive customer satisfaction – which in turn led to more customers.

Netflix first became profitable in 2003, when the streaming giant earned $6.5 million on a reported revenue of $272.24 million.

BRRRR investing is another effective strategy made popular by Brandon Turner on Bigger Pockets. BRRRR stands for buy, rehab, rent, refinance and repeat:

Buy: Buy a property at below-market value.

Rehab: Renovate and improve the property by adding value.

Rent: Rent out the property to cover the mortgage.

Refinance: Get the property reappraised, then use cash-out refinancing to secure an advantageous mortgage.

Repeat: Use the capital you recovered from the deal to invest in more properties.

With BRRRR, the idea is to capitalize on a property others may have overlooked due to its low face value or apparent lack of potential.

Passive income enables businesses to build their wealth and improve cash flow, leading to increased financial stability and security. In effect, passive income increases bottom line profits, saves time and expands a business’s reach. For some entrepreneurs, passive income allows for location independence, as in the case of digital nomads.

Other benefits of passive income may include less stress, time to pursue other projects and passions, and early retirement. But remember, these benefits come from a significant amount of time spent in active income pursuits, sometimes for years, before passive income begins to stream in.

The primary benefit of investing in passive income is that it has the potential to generate consistent returns with minimal effort. Passive income can help diversify your portfolio beyond traditional investments such as stocks and bonds by providing alternative returns such as rental properties or royalties from published works. Investing in passive income allows you to get your money working for you since and not actively monitor your investments daily.

Some of the features of the initiatives introduced by the quartet include affordability, bypassing orthodox channels by designing frames in-house, and taking cognizance of customers’ specifications.
The company which was set up under the Wharton School’s Venture Initiation Program was created to close the perceived existing lacuna between users of medicated glasses and the providers of such services. Though the idea was hatched in 2008, the business did not commence operations until two years later.


Slack was originally developed as a solution to a problem for game developers. In 2011, Tiny Speck was developing the online game ‘‘Glitch’’ and found that there wasn’t a team collaboration tool on the market that met their needs. So they created one! Through this, Slack was born. In the first 24 hours of its launch, 8,000 companies signed up for Slack in 2013.

 

The tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.

A lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying. Not only did you have to go to a grocery store or pharmacy, but usually the razors were locked on the shelf or guarded behind the checkout counter. You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.

Because of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”

Thus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.

The tool was called Slack, and it soon became the focus of the company after developers saw the potential. They renamed their company Slack Technologies, and began to market their new product. The core team was drawn from the founders of Flickr, leveraging their Silicon Valley network to build out the new venture. In 2014, Slack raised $120 million, giving the company a whopping valuation of $1.12 billion and Slack became the fastest company in history to achieve a billion dollar valuation.

A lightbulb went off in Michael’s head. He had always been frustrated by the cost of razor blades. Furthermore, the buying process was annoying. Not only did you have to go to a grocery store or pharmacy, but usually the razors were locked on the shelf or guarded behind the checkout counter. You needed to ask a sales associate to unlock the rack, only to shell out $20 for four or five blades.

Because of this frustration, he thought, “What if I created a subscription service that sent blades to customers automatically every month, at a reasonable price?”

Thus, the Dollar Shave Club was born.

Because of the lattice organizational structure, even the decision-making is decentralized. As mentioned in the Amazon.com section of the paper, coordination has three mechanisms: rules and directives, mutual adjustment, and routines (GRANT, 2019, p. 137). However, rules and directives, and routines do notably in Gore's case. The only mutual adjustment could be applied. Employees coordinate their acts without order or schedules. The mutual adjustment takes place in leaderless organizations (GRANT, 2019, p. 137). As mentioned in the case, employees can choose any project or team that they feel comfortable with as long as they commit to it and finish what they start as peer to peer.

More self-management and autonomy
The Spotify model encourages autonomy and creativity by trusting people to complete the work they are doing in the way they see fit. Do you need to ship software? That’s up to the Squad. Do you need to change direction? That’s also up to the Squad. The Spotify model focuses on decentralizing decision making and transferring that responsibility to Squads, Tribes, Chapters, and Guilds.
