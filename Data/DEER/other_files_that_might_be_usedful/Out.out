Warning: long: Tigers are terrestrial mammals that belong to the genus “Panthera” a classification that groups the five species of big cats: lions, jaguars, leopards, snow leopards, and tigers. They are easily recognizable by their unique black striped pattern on a dark orange coat and because they are the largest species of the Felidae family. The tiger (Panthera tigris) is the largest of the five big cats that belong to the genus “Panthera.”;

Warning: long: Scorpions primarily prey on insects and other invertebrates, but some species hunt vertebrates. They use their pincers to restrain and kill prey, or to prevent their own predation. The venomous sting is used for offense and defense. During courtship, the male and female grasp each other's pincers and dance while he tries to move her onto his sperm packet. All known species give live birth and the female cares for the young as their exoskeletons harden, transporting them on her back. The exoskeleton contains fluorescent chemicals and glows under ultraviolet light.;

Warning: long: As with all amniotes, lizards rely on internal fertilisation and copulation involves the male inserting one of his hemipenes into the female's cloaca.[21] The majority of species are oviparous (egg laying). The female deposits the eggs in a protective structure like a nest or crevice or simply on the ground.[22] Depending on the species, clutch size can vary from 4–5 percent of the females body weight to 40–50 percent and clutches range from one or a few large eggs to dozens of small ones.[23];

Warning: long: The apple tree is an angiosperm or flowering plant. Angiosperms make their first unmistakable appearance in the fossil record during the Cretaceous period (Kenrick & Davis 2004, p. 195). New reproductive strategies helped angiosperms become a great success and diversify into the forms we know today. Male and female structures develop within flowers. Many organisms such as birds, bats, and insects have coevolved to help pollinate angiosperms. Animals have also coevolved to help disperse the seeds of angiosperms.;
short:The apple tree is an angiosperm or flowering plant.
Warning: long: Pears are fruits produced and consumed around the world, growing on a tree and harvested in the Northern Hemisphere in late summer into October. The pear tree and shrub are a species of genus Pyrus /ˈpaɪrəs/, in the family Rosaceae, bearing the pomaceous fruit of the same name. Several species of pears are valued for their edible fruit and juices, while others are cultivated as trees.;

Warning: long: Polar bears have long provided important raw materials for Arctic peoples, including the Inuit, Yupik, Chukchi, Nenets, Russian Pomors and others. Hunters commonly used teams of dogs to distract the bear, allowing the hunter to spear the bear or shoot it with arrows at closer range. Almost all parts of captured animals had a use. The fur was used in particular to make trousers and, by the Nenets, to make galoshes-like outer footwear called tobok; the meat is edible, despite some risk of trichinosis; the fat was used in food and as a fuel for lighting homes, alongside seal and whale blubber; sinews were used as thread for sewing clothes; the gallbladder and sometimes heart were dried and powdered for medicinal purposes; the large canine teeth were highly valued as talismans. Only the liver was not used, as its high concentration of vitamin A is poisonous. As a carnivore, which feeds largely upon fish-eating carnivores, the polar bear ingests large amounts of vitamin A that is stored in their livers. The resulting high concentrations cause hypervitaminosis A,Hunters make sure to either toss the liver into the sea or bury it in order to spare their dogs from potential poisoning. Traditional subsistence hunting was on a small enough scale to not significantly affect polar bear populations, mostly because of the sparseness of the human population in polar bear habitat.;

Warning: long: So, what's the difference? Perennial plants regrow every spring, while annual plants live for only one growing season, then die off. Perennials generally have a shorter blooming period compared to annuals, so it's common for gardeners to use a combination of both plants in their yard.;

Warning: long: Like mountains, they reinforce a limited defense; but their peculiar characteristic is that they act like a tool made of a hard and brittle substance: they either stand the heaviest blow undented, or their defensive capacity falls to pieces and then ceases completely. If the river is very wide, and all other conditions are favorable, a crossing may be absolutely impossible. Bu once the defense is breached at any point, the kind of resistance in depth that would occur in mountains does not take place. The matter is settled in this single act, unless the river happens to flow through mountainous terrain.;

Warning: long: Crabs are generally covered with a thick exoskeleton, composed primarily of highly mineralized chitin,[4][5] and armed with a pair of chelae (claws). Crabs vary in size from the pea crab, a few millimeters wide, to the Japanese spider crab, with a leg span up to 4 m (13 ft).[6] Several other groups of crustaceans with similar appearances – such as king crabs and porcelain crabs – are not true crabs, but have evolved features similar to true crabs through a process known as carcinisation.[7][8][9][10];

Warning: long: Carrot is a herbaceous root vegetable, Daucus carota subsp. sativus, in the parsley family (Apiaceae or Umbelliferae), which also includes the similar parsnip. The domesticated carrot is a cultivar of the wild carrot (Daucus carota), also known as "Queen Anne's lace," which is native to temperate parts of Europe and southwest Asia. The term carrot also applies to the long, edible, usually tapering taproot of the domesticated form. These taproots commonly are orange in color, but may be a variety of colors depending on the cultivar, including white, pink, yellow, or purple. They have a crisp texture when fresh.;

Warning: long: Saturn has a hot interior, reaching 11,700 °C at its core, and radiates 2.5 times more energy into space than it receives from the Sun. Jupiter's thermal energy is generated by the Kelvin–Helmholtz mechanism of slow gravitational compression, but such a process alone may not be sufficient to explain heat production for Saturn, because it is less massive. An alternative or additional mechanism may be generation of heat through the "raining out" of droplets of helium deep in Saturn's interior. As the droplets descend through the lower-density hydrogen, the process releases heat by friction and leaves Saturn's outer layers depleted of helium.[47][48] These descending droplets may have accumulated into a helium shell surrounding the core.[38] Rainfalls of diamonds have been suggested to occur within Saturn, as well as in Jupiter[49] and ice giants Uranus and Neptune.;
